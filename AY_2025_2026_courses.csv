The study of race in the social sciences and humanities is an established, dynamic, multidisciplinary, and international field. To understand race and racism with a global perspective, it is necessary to have a transdisciplinary, cross- cultural view to read critically the phenomena that intersect with this variable. Course readings are drawn from the fields of African and African American Studies, sociology, history, cultural studies, political science, anthropology, philosophy, journalism, and public health. The vast literature produced by scholars in diverse fields provides evidence of how race is based on narratives created to enslave, subordinate, exploit, and exclude millions of human beings across the globe. Assignments will address pressing real-world questions related to race and racism, as well as pedagogically significant areas of undergraduate intellectual and academic development."

How do destination images condition our perceptions of native people, public space and collective memory? This seminar explores tourism beyond its facile association with leisure to consider its implications for development, environmental protection, heritage conservation, and the commodification of history. Treating tourism as an enterprise that trades in everything from sensory fantasies to cheap cosmetic surgeries and pictures of tropical paradise, this course contemplates the role of the imaginary in the political and the political in the imaginary. Through careful analysis of travel journals, audiovisual material and first hand accounts from culture brokers and travelers alike, we'll explore the industry's colonial past in relation to Black, Indigenous and queer people's efforts to bend tourism towards a more libratory future. While geographically situated in Latin America and the Caribbean, the course draws from comparative contexts in continental Africa and the United States to critically analyze tourism in relation to colonialism, the plantation economy, African diasporic kinship and the afterlives of slavery. Readings include classic texts such as Jamaica Kincaid's (1988) A Small Place, Kamala Kempadoo's Sun, Sex and Gold (1999) Paulla Ebron's Performing Africa (2002), Mimi Sheller´s Consuming the Caribbean (2003) and Saidiya Hartman's Loose Your Mother (2008). These works will be paired with Florence Babb's The Tourism Encounter (2010) Jemima Pierre's Predicament of Blackness (2009) Krista Thompson's An Eye for the Tropics (2016), and recent ethnographies such as Christen Smith's Afro-Paradise (2016), Megan Rivers-Moore's Gringo Gluch (2016) Patricia Pinho's Mapping Diaspora (2018), Bianca Williams's The Pursuit of Happiness (2018), Corinna Campbell's The Cultural Work (2020), and Anadelia A.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences,AFRAMER,143Y,African Landscape Architecture: Alternative Futures for the Field,224017,2026 Spring,4,,,,,Social Sciences,Instructor Permission Required,"Gareth Doherty A central aim of this seminar is to reveal the plurality of ways landscapes are shaped across the African continent and how they help mitigate the impacts of changing climates and social injustice now and in the future. Africa is a continent rich in landscape projects and practices but only eight out of fifty-four African nations have professional associations of landscape architects. The course is framed around three central questions: 1.) How is landscape architecture currently practiced in African countries? (2.) What lessons can we learn from landscape practices in various African societies that can help mitigate the impacts of climate change and social inequities? (3.) As landscape architecture unfolds across the continent in the next 50–200 years, how can it continue assert its agency in the fight against changing climates and social inequity and claim a central space in the shaping of African cities of the future? Each week we will focus on a different country including South Africa, Botswana, Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria. In collaboration with several landscape architecture university programs across Africa and including practitioners and academics from across the continent, this seminar will explore what it means to practice and teach landscape architecture in societies in which the profession is nascent or non-existent and speculate on the future of the shaping of landscapes in the Global South."

Mentioning the genre elicits questions over origins and boundaries. While oft forgotten, Black queer, femme, and non-binary people invented the modern-day genre's arrangement, composition, production, and distribution, undergirding distressed communities' sonic landscapes, enlivening social movements, and seeding multibillion-dollar markets. From disco to house to techno, each seminar will crisscross wide-ranging geographies including Chicago, Detroit, New York, and Manchester, United Kingdom. We will pair essential LPs, EPs, singles, and bootleg recordings with thematically linked texts in history, musicology, and theory to ask how Black electronic musicians responded to history's unfolding."

It asks why the United States has not guaranteed a right to healthcare, unlike most other advanced, industrialized, and wealthy countries. Within the United States' federated system, the place of healthcare varies widely amidst other demands for social insurance, which includes unemployment benefits, parental leave, childcare, and pensions. From comparative to national perspective, this course engages American political economy's public-private mix; anti-immigration sentiment's and segregation's limits on national health insurance; the Civil Rights Movement's healthcare reforms; the persistent reproduction of health inequality despite de jure desegregation; resistance to and breakthroughs for Medicaid expansion in the contemporary era; and prospects for future reform."

This course explores African languages as rich sources of knowledge that require collection and cataloguing using current AI technologies. By examining archives of African thought and life, students will delve into how archival information can be shared across languages. The course emphasizes the significance of African languages as instruments of thought, expressed through signs and sounds, in various domains such as constitution writing, food production, governance, religion, and environmental use/protection. Students will critically engage with the organic sociality of vernacular spaces, including church rooms, courtrooms, classrooms, hospital rooms, and entrepreneurial spaces, where African languages are linguistically accessible. Course Objectives:- Understand the role of language as an instrument of thought and communication in African societies.- Explore African languages as archives of knowledge and their importance in preserving cultural heritage.- Gain knowledge of AI technologies and their application in collecting and cataloguing African language archives.- Examine the significance of archival information sharing across different African languages.- Analyze the critical engagements that take place in vernacular spaces and their impact on African communities.- Understand the linguistic accessibility of African languages in various social contexts."

The course strives to open up a critical, open-ended discussion that treats Africa as People, and reclaims the epistemic freedom and virtue of African people through a double-consciousness of deprovincializing Africa and provincializing Europe. The course will examine the lines of knowledge production in Africa, beyond hegemonic Eurocentric knowledge-production, with the aim of achieving what the writer Chinua Achebe calls a balance of stories. What, for instance, does a decolonized, African-centered approach to knowledge production look like? Ultimately, the course belies entrenched and racialized notions of Africa as a residual category, the study of which adds nothing (theoretically) meaningful to world knowledge or the human condition."

Du Bois was among the most profound thinkers of his time, devoting a forensic and evolving attention to the issue of race over a varied career that extended from the turn of the century to his death on the eve of the March on Washington in 1963. Although he earned his PhD from Harvard in history, he is increasingly seen as one of the pioneering scholars in the then-nascent field of sociology. In this course, we will employ a structure of text and critique to evaluate the reach and utility of his ideas, on subjects ranging from the development of racial consciousness to nuclear disarmament to the international order and the role of Africa, Africans, and African Americans in it. This course will examine Du Bois's original writings in the context of the debates they sparked and will revisit his interactions with key figures, both Black and white, of the twentieth century."

Earlier generations of scholars relied heavily on European legal traditions to draw sharp contrasts between U.S. and Latin American slavery. The most recent scholarship, however, approaches the legal history of slavery through slaves' legal initiatives and actions. These initiatives were probably informed by the Africans' legal cultures, as many of them came from societies where slavery was practiced. Our seminar puts African legal regimes (customary law, Islamic law) at the center of our explorations concerning slaves' legal actions in the Americas."

How might attention to the time and space in which words are spoken allow us to treat oral history as text, and text as oral history? This course explores storytelling as a foundational element of the human experience. It analyzes the myriad ways in which orality has been used to consolidate origin stories, document events, communicate embodied experience, and transfer ancestral knowledge. By centering methodology, students will learn to prepare, collect, analyze, and share oral histories in a variety of written, digital, and artistic forms. Topics of discussion include how to build relationships, conduct interviews around difficult topics, and use citational practices that honor nonhuman and other-than-human actors. Required readings pair classic and new oral histories with texts on the theory, practice, and ethics of storytelling. By centering works by Black, Indigenous, gender minorities, and writers of color, the course examines how storytelling is used to establish and redistribute power. At the end of the semester, students will become familiar with audio-visual recording technology, learn to navigate transcription and coding software, and be able to conduct, transcribe and analyze an oral history."

Decolonization left African states and policymaker with many decisions regarding what states should do politically, economically, socially, and culturally. How should states create a national identity out of an emerging anti-colonial consciousness? Given the challenges of colonial rule, how could postcolonial state create vibrant economies and durable political systems, especially given the damage done by colonial rule. This seminar will engage with the newest works by historians, anthropologists, political scientists, and other scholars who have analyzed the postcolonial state in Africa, drawing on case studies from across the continent."

We will analyze how African and black diasporic authors and intellectuals have engaged with, revised, and re-imagined the classics of ancient Greece and Rome, both to expose and critique discourses of racism, imperialism, colonialism, and white supremacy, and as a rich source of radical self-expression. The course will be arranged thematically, taking in uses of Classics in literature, art, journalism, and politics. Writers, artists, and politicians whose work and ideas we will study include Phillis Wheatley, William Sanders Scarborough, Anna Julia Cooper, Pauline Hopkins, Mary Church Terrell, Edmonia Lewis, W.E.B.

An axiom of contemporary life is that societies need law to address social, political and environmental ills. Yet, in the face of entrenched problems, law often appears impotent or, worse, detrimental. This course grapples with the simultaneous hunger for and weakness of law, its power and its powerlessness, by guiding students through an exploration of the following questions. What is the relation between law and violence? How does legal process transform conflict and define the terms of its resolution? Can law restrain arbitrary power? How, why and to whose benefit or expense is the legal posed as an answer to political and social problems? The course will seek answers to these questions via an engagement with the ethnographic – close readings of a variety of judicial processes -- and the theoretical. In so doing, the course will be guided by two objectives: 1. to compile a toolkit of methods and concepts with which social scientists have studied law and 2. to trouble commonsense pieties about law and its place in social life."

In doing so, we grapple with the legacy of anthropology's colonial past to understand questions of power and knowledge production in social anthropological thought. The texts chosen for this course both give insight into the history of the discipline and the wide variety of human (and non-human) existence that anthropologists have written about, with particular attention to pressing ethical questions in contemporary debates in social anthropology. Additionally, the texts chosen represent a variety of writing styles, theoretical approaches, and worldviews that introduce you to the exciting breadth of this ambitious discipline, which strives to give a holistic analysis of what it means to be human.

What happens when we shift our gaze from fixed places to flows of people, ideas, and things? In this introductory-level class in sociocultural anthropology, we explore how mobility creates new social landscapes across the region. Through anthropological methods—especially immersive fieldwork and ethnographic writing—we will examine how historical patterns of migration and present-day movements are shaped by structural dynamics of colonialism, late capitalism, labor markets, trade networks, and supply chains. Through ethnographic encounters that reveal the complexity of mobility: from maritime trade in the Indian Ocean to domestic workers in Singapore, from transnational mothers in Filipino families to Islamic networks in Southeast China, from Persian rug merchants to Japanese-Philippine solidarity trade. Through these examples, we explore how restrictive policies create new regimes of (im)mobility and forms of nationalism, while also examining the lived experiences of individuals and families involved in transnational lives. The seminar guides students through key themes including physical geography, commodity chains, religious networks, and logistics systems. At the end of the class, students will develop conceptual tools to examine the mechanics of mobility, equipping them to address the pivotal questions emerging from our increasingly interconnected world.

We will consider the voice as, among other things, an object, a medium, a concept, a metaphor, and a philosophical problem. The voice will take us to the linguistics of speech, the aesthetics of song and musical composition, the anatomy and evolution of the human throat, the stylistics and narrative of literature and storytelling, technologies of speech recognition and artificial production, the structures of political participation and activism, the rituals of spiritual contact and possession, the expressive dimensions of social identity, the interior dimensions of selfhood, and the circulating media of global social life. Seminar meetings will consist of a combination of lecture, class discussion, student presentations, and media analysis.

Modes of practice will include audio recording, sound design, editing, and postproduction. We will begin by examining the rubric of multimodality in the context of anthropology, and its ethical implications and possibilities for approaches to sensory ethnography. Projects will ideally be ones already underway by each student, and will also include opportunities for collaboration with fellow students. Through readings and listening sessions (or screenings) we will also listen beyond the academy to experiments in other domains, including sound art, ethnographic film, and other nonfiction media practices. The course seeks to problematize, perhaps even undermine, and reformulate ideas and practices which combine audio with moving image or other media. Aesthetics and ethics, theory and technique, concept and practice are interwoven at every level in multimodal work, and so this course will combine technical workshops with working through conceptual and theoretical motivations and implications of the work throughout the semester. Rather than taking up conventions or formulae, the course will provide a space for experimentation, to reconsider possibilities in an expanded sense of nonfiction for relationships between audio and image, text, or other media.

Many of these communities attribute this distress to their long colonial encounters with European settlers. Concurrently, throughout the 20th century, the disciplines and professions associated with mind, brain, and behavior (e.g., psychiatry, psychoanalysis, psychology) consolidated their authority and influence within mainstream society. These psy-ences promote their professional practices (e.g., diagnosis, psychotherapy) as plausible remedies for Indigenous social suffering, but many Indigenous communities remain skeptical of—and resistant to—these clinical approaches, primarily for cultural and political reasons. In this seminar, we will consider whether and how the concepts, categories, tools, and techniques of the mental health professions might be appropriately adapted and/or adopted for use with Indigenous communities in an increasingly globalized world. In recognition of the (post)colonial status of these populations, we will attend closely to alterNative cultural and spiritual approaches that have been identified and promoted by Indigenous people themselves as conducive to healing and wellness. This course is designed for upper-level undergraduate students interested in medical anthropology, professional psychology, pre-medicine, Indigenous studies, and related social and health sciences. Students will participate in regular seminar discussions, write routine responses to assigned readings, and submit major independent research papers addressed to the promotion of Indigenous well-being.

While designing mathematical models is itself an art form, it is equally important to learn how to transform them into computational systems that allow robust evaluation, which is critical for real-world use cases, from modeling the spread of COVID, to designing better large language models. This course introduces mathematical modeling ideas while teaching how to transform them into robust computational frameworks for model evaluation and deployment, as done in industry. The aim is to give both a broad view of what a mathematical model is and, at the same time, to teach the core computational skills for building usable state-of- the-art models.

The course will emphasize the entire pipeline from writing a model, estimating its parameters and performing inference utilizing real data. The first part of the course will focus on linear and nonlinear probabilistic generative/regression models (e.g. linear, logistic, Poisson regression), and algorithms for optimization (ML/MAP estimation) and Bayesian inference in these models. We will play particular attention to sparsity-induced regression models, because of their relation to artificial neural networks, the topic of the second part of the course. The second part of the course will introduce students to the nascent and exciting research area of model-based deep learning. At present, we lack a principled way to design artificial neural networks, the workhorses of modern AI systems. Moreover, modern AI systems lack the ability to explain how they reach their decisions. In other words, we cannot yet call AI explainable or interpretable which, as a society, poses important questions as to the responsible use of such technology. Model-based deep learning provides a framework to develop and constrain neural-network architectures in a principled fashion. We will see, for instance, how neural- networks with ReLU nonlinearites arise from sparse probabilistic generative models introduced in the first part of the course. This will form the basis for a rigorous recipe we will teach you to build interpretable deep neural networks, from the ground up. We will invite an exciting line up of speakers. Time permitting, we will provide a model-based pespective of the building blocks of modern language and image generative models. for credit.

This course reviews the foundations of causal inference in (bio)statistics, outlining causal-analytic methods that help to extract as much evidence as imperfect observational studies carry about causal effects commonly of interest in applied health science settings. This survey of statistical causal inference begins with foundational concepts: the potential outcomes framework and counterfactual random variables, graphical modeling frameworks, and common assumptions and strategies for the identification of the causal effects of static and dynamic interventions. Methodological extensions for studying the causal effects of time-varying, longitudinal interventions will be touched upon as well. Further topics to be addressed may include instrumental variables approaches, principal stratification, causal mediation analysis, treatment effect heterogeneity, the causal dose-response curve, and causal survival analysis. This course may also introduce elements of semi-parametric theory necessary for the development of asymptotically efficient estimators of causal effect estimands. Where possible, the role of modern regression (i.e., machine learning) techniques and tools for the practical estimation of causal effect estimands will be emphasized."

We will be reading, in translation from Latin and Middle Welsh, the earliest surviving texts featuring the figure of Arthur as well as the retinue of the legendary figures, such as Guinevere and Merlin, who are popularly associated with him. We try and get behind the familiar cast of characters, as arguably first found in Geoffrey of Monmouth' s History of the Kings of Britain, and trace how the more familiar later narratives developed.

CLS-STDY 114 Constantinople Alexander Riehle Overlooking the Bosphorus Strait, which separates Europe from Asia, the city founded by Constantine I in 324 at the location of ancient Byzantion would become the capital of the Roman Empire, a bustling medieval metropolis, and a site of rich imagination: to the Byzantines it was the New Rome or simply the City, foreigners it inspired with awe and admiration. This seminar explores the city of Constantinople as a physical and mental space by examining archaeological remains and textual and visual sources. We will discuss the city's geography and topography; its place in imperial and religious ideology; private and public institutions such schools, hospitals, and orphanages; daily life, economy, commerce, and demographics; the excavation, preservation, and transformation of monuments; and native, foreign, and modern-day perceptions. CLS-STDY 166 Bob Dylan the Classic Richard Thomas This course examines Bob Dylan the creative genius and enduring and continuing musical, literary, and general cultural phenomenon, in the context of popular and higher literary culture of the last 60 years, and of performed literature; also in the context of those long-lived literary and musical cultures with which he works: the Beats and Moderns of the 20th and Romantics of the 19th century; Poe, Melville, Whitman and Americana of the same 19th century; Shakespeare and the old ballad traditions; John Donne and the Metaphysical poets; Dante, Petrarch and the Troubadours; and in more recent songs going back to Homer, Virgil, Ovid, and the western literary canon. Traces the evolution of his songs and lyrics from their early folk, blues, rock, gospel, and protest roots, through the transition from acoustic to electric, in studio and performative contexts, also through the many persona evolutions and reinventions that have characterized and continue to characterize his career in songwriting, performance, literature, film and painting. Lectures, listening to, viewing, and discussing a broad representation of Dylan's output. This course has an enrollment cap.

Self-definition, ethnicity, and identity can be fascinating, especially when probed by looking at people from different times and places. Self-discovery is enriched by fresh learning, together with discovery of others.In a sense, there is only one Rome, and it has been styled eternal. At the same time, many Romes have existed. To start at the beginning, why were the Romans called Roman? What was it to be a Roman citizen?Moving on to Late Antiquity and beyond, let's look at why there was a New Rome or Second Rome, and why it is fair or unfair to talk about Byzantine culture. A related puzzle, why does the thirteenth- century Islamic poet and mystic Rumi have that epithet? To turn to religion, we have the expression Roman Catholic. In matters of Church and State, why was the Holy Roman Empire Roman? Incidentally, what makes Roman Law Roman?Why did Romans speak Latin—or did they all speak Latin? Why did other languages develop that have been termed Romance? Why do some fictions qualify as romances? Why are feelings associated with love romantic? Why does a kind of art and architecture go by the adjective Romanesque?A few big, overarching questions: What claims to Romanness have been made for the US? Why was there a Third Rome—and where was (or is) it? Which has been more Roman, Russia or America—and is that good, bad, or neutral? What is Roman today? CLS-STDY 174 Roman Freedpersons CLS-STDY 182 The Economy of Roman Alexandria Irene Soto Marin This course explores the vibrant and interconnected economy of Roman Alexandria, emphasizing its role as both a producer of goods and knowledge, as well as a central player in long-distance trade. Students will delve into the city's diverse industries, including the production of textiles, fine arts, and jewelry, alongside the redistribution of essential goods such as grain, rope, and luxury imports like pepper. The course will also examine Alexandria's significant contributions to science, medicine, and philosophy, as well as its political influence, with the urban elite holding land across Egypt and maintaining strong ties with the Roman Emperor and court. Alexandria's strategic location further established it as a vital gateway to the Red Sea, facilitating trade routes to the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Indian Ocean, promoting extensive cultural exchange. Through the study of papyri, archaeological findings, coins, and literary sources, this course highlights Alexandria's unparalleled status as a cosmopolitan center of culture, commerce, and intellectual activity during the Roman period. CLS-STDY 194 Sports and Athletics in Ancient Greece and Rome Mark Schiefsky A study of athletics and sport in the ancient Greek and Roman worlds. Through a close study of primary sources (in English), modern secondary literature, and ancient archaeological evidence, the course explores the origins and development of the major ancient athletic contests (particularly the Olympic Games); the theory and practice of athletic training; the relationship between athletics and other forms of bodily care, such as medicine; and the changing relationship of athletics and education in ancient and modern times. Students will make use of materials in the Harvard Art Museums and the archaeological excavations in ancient Olympia. No prior knowledge of the ancient world is assumed. consult the course site for more details. This class will have a discussion section. Students should add the untimed placeholder (DIS), and sectioning preferences will be collected after registration.

Self-translation refers to the process through which authors translate their own writing into another language; such a translation may be undertaken at the same time as the original is composed or long after it is completed, but it always represents a self-reflexive relationship between the author and their own work. Because the self-translator has access to the original's authorial intentions, they are empowered to take creative liberties that a conventional translator might shy away from. Through these creative liberties, self- translators enrich the cultural capital of both their native and adopted language and culture. Self-translation, in this way, often involves writing oneself into world literature, creating cosmopolitan palimpsests that reveal, in their dialogue with diverse cultural traditions, the nonlinear forms of modernity. In this course, we will delve into case studies of self-translation from East Asia, East Africa, Latin America, North America, and Italy. We will also investigate the implications of self-transmediation, which occurs when an author adapts their own work into another medium, transporting that work from the page to the stage to the screen, for instance. For the final assignment, students will produce their own work of self-translation or transmediation."

At the same time, the AI boom has raised profound questions about creativity as an essentially human trait and inspired widespread concern about AI impacts on human and nonhuman environments–or all creation. Observers often describe the moral and existential challenges that such innovations present as new and unprecedented. But, in fact the concern is at least several centuries old. Drawing on canonical works of literature, philosophy, and cinema, this course will offer an introduction to the long history of thinking about, and working with, new technologies in the arts and humanities. In addition to close reading and analysis, students will engage in a series of critical making projects using historical artifacts housed in Harvard's collections and brand-new generative AI tools developed specifically for us.

Weekly discussions will center on close readings of selected love poems and versified narrratives from a variety of literary traditions, including: Provençal troubadour lyric; French chansons, the Germanic Minnesang and the Galician-Portuguese cantigas (the question of amour courtois); Ibero-Romance and colloquial Arabic jarchas; the Italian dolce stil novo; the Petrarchan sonnet and its early modern heirs in Portugal, England and Spain; Arabo-Andalusian and Hispano-Jewish qaṣā'id and muwashshaḥāt, medieval Latin love lyric; Persian Sufi and Christian mystical love poetry; Dante's Vita nuova; and selections from two other erotological classics in narrative verse, Libro de buen amor and Roman de la Rose. Discussions will be framed by an overview of both premodern discussions on love – how love is conceptualized at the intersection of philosophy, theology and medicine by Jewish, Christian and Muslim thinkers– and contemporary scholarly debates on the origins and development of medieval love literature."

In many respects, computers have served the interests of capital, by creating new modes of accumulation and means of automating, managing, and outsourcing labor, as well as new tools for researching, advertising to, and transacting with customers. However, computers have also been described as fundamentally changing or even overcoming capitalism–both for better and for worse. Theorists have credited computers with eliminating work or turning it into play and transforming market exchanges into gift exchanges. Contemporary platforms and artificial intelligence inspire dreams of fully automated luxury communism and fears that law and contracts are being replaced by code and neo-colonial or neo-feudal forms of coercion.In this seminar, we will engage with an outpouring of recent scholarship that attempts to describe and theorize digital capitalism and culture, pairing recent texts with excerpts from canonical works that their authors cite and build upon. In the process, students will gain exposure to key concepts, debates, and methods in the emerging field(s) of critical data studies, new media studies, and platform studies. We will also reflect upon the nature and purpose of theorizing. A series of assignments and workshops over the course of the semester will guide students through the process of identifying a promising research topic, reviewing scholarly literature, articulating an original research question, and writing a review essay or research paper."

The course then transitions to Python, a higher-level language that you'll understand all the more because of C. Toward term's end, the course introduces SQL, via which you can store data in databases, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, via which you can create web and mobile apps alike. Course culminates in a final project. See https://cs50.harvard.edu/college for advice, FAQs, syllabus, and what's new.

In many of these processes the actual steps taken by biological systems are not currently understood. Further, even the outcomes that are being realized by these processes are not well understood. In general, current understanding of most aspects of biology is not complete or specific enough to provide theories in which predictions can be made by analysis or computer simulation. Computer science is the study of step-by- step processes and of specifications of the outcomes that such processes can realize. For many computational outcome specifications, it is known or believed that no mechanism with feasible resources can realize them. Computer science therefore offers a top-down approach to understanding what could possibly be computed in biology, and how. In this course we shall pursue this computational complexity approach, whose origins go back to Turing and von Neumann. Emphasis will be on evolution and neuroscience, but other topics such as development will be also discussed.

However, the question of what approach is best for what context remains elusive. In this course, we will focus on computational properties of interpretable machine learning methods, such as faithfulness or stability. Assessing methods with respect to these properties may allow us to rule out poorly-performing approaches without the need for expensive user studies. By categorizing methods by their computational properties, we will also be able to start thinking about which methods might be useful for a specific context. After a few initial assignments, the course will be focused on reading papers, discussion, and a semester-long project. Students are expected to be fluent in basic linear algebra (matrix manipulation), basic statistics (e.g. rules of expecations, importance sampling), basic reinforcement learning (at a CS1810/181 level), and basic software engineering (e.g. programming in Python and numpy, data with 10,000+ rows)."

E-PSCI 166 State-of-the-Art Harvard Climate Observatory and Associated Instrumentation James Anderson ESE/EPS 166 engages the new Harvard Climate Observatory that will fundamentally herald a new era in both climate research and the development of strategic approaches to advancing the climate impact on public policy. The central objective of the New Climate Observatory is to address this problem by introducing, for the first time, the development of a new generation of innovative technology that takes explicit advantage of recent major advances in Harvard-based instruments and optical designs in combination with advanced solar powered stratospheric aeronautical design. The new solar powered stratospheric aircraft that together constitute the Climate Observatory engage multiple recent design innovations in photovoltaics, energy storage, as well as guidance and control. Together these enable a combination of long duration solar powered observing systems, each targeted at the highest priority risk factors that threaten global societal stability. The resulting observations will, for the first time, provide the irrefutable evidence needed for quantitative forecasts of the dominant risk factors stemming from the global use of fossil fuels.While satellites have for years dominated the federal climate programs, for the purpose of developing tested and trusted quantitative forecasts of risk, satellites engender significant disadvantages. In sharp contrast to satellite systems, the new Harvard Climate Observatory provides, for the first time, orders of magnitude improvement in spatial and temporal resolution observations. ESE/EPS 166 will focus explicitly on this new generation of climate observations, forecasting, and resulting advances in public policy.

Drawing on ethnographic writings from Japan, China, Inner Asia, Nepal, Vietnam, and other regions, we will explore how Buddhist practitioners and communities are conceptualizing and addressing the unprecedented impact of human beings on global environmental processes.

Theoretical readings will allow students to apply what they learn to a variety of topics beyond East Asia for final papers and projects. Topics will engage with issues of gender, colonialism, and racialization in inter- Asian and internationalist contexts. Methods of analysis will include examining 1) the image of fashion and clothing (photographs, film, visual media, memory); 2) fashion as text, or written clothing—how clothing becomes fashion through discourse; and 3) the materiality of dress. To study materiality, the course includes a lab section where students will examine closely textiles and articles of clothing in the collections of the Harvard Museums, and engage in materials workshops (learning for example weaving and dyeing techniques). Students will be encouraged to make connections between form and function and meaning, and to incorporate a knowledge of technological constraint and possibility into their own analyses of clothing and fashion.

Moving from Chinese farm households in Mozambique to state-owned copper mines in Zambia, military bases in East Africa and the United Nations headquarters, this seminar critically assesses the potential for China's presence to transform Sub-Saharan Africa. After identifying the intellectual stakes (week 1), and discussing anecdotal glimpses from the grassroot- levels (week 2), the class deals with traditional development assistance, along with Maoist attempts to revolutionize the world countryside – resulting in legacies such as a China-trained guerilla fighter serving as the President of Zimbabwe. We then discuss the current footprint of Beijing, including its influence on elite politics, Chinese public and private business interests, and the diversity of the one million Chinese migrants to Africa. Four sessions specialize on (1) resource extraction versus opportunities for human capital development (2) debt- traps of Western and Eastern origins (3) emerging tensions over human rights policies (4) and the military dimension, including China's role in Peace-Keeping Operations. Finally, the course addressees how the Chinese presence may transform established multilateral institutions, and the challenges associated with African migration to China. Social science research will be read alongside journalistic accounts and primary documents, such as leaked diplomatic cables and strategy papers. Will Africa become Beijing's Second Continent, of the neo-colonial or tributary kind? What promises does the China model hold for Africans? How do the partners on both continents react to experiences of disillusionment and retreat?

Beyond its specific weekly agendas, the course is intended to provide a comfortable space to voice concerns, discuss anxieties, identify fears, and share successes. Students are encouraged to raise issues about teaching and professional growth. The syllabus is flexible and can respond to student needs and concerns as the semester progresses, so please be sure to provide your feedback as we go along.

The Mongol Empire has variously been credited with the inaugural establishment of a globalized world with unprecedented religious toleration and socio-economic exchange. Yet, the Mongols have also been maligned for the mass slaughter of their conquests, brutal deportation policies as well as destruction of Islamic and Chinese urban societies. Between the twin poles of efflorescence and catastrophe lies a rich geography to explore. Who was this steppe people that came to rule the largest contiguous empire in history? What underwrote their rise? How did they order such a vast realm? How much was the Mongol period a watershed for globalization? What legacy did they leave behind for successor states, cultures and the globe? We begin by looking closely at the nature of the agglomeration of peoples that eventually became known as the Mongols and how state formation in the steppe created the momentum for conquest. Next, we explore how steppe military culture combined with new technologies and operational strategies that empowered the Mongol military machine. We then turn to questions of localized rule and gender in Mongol-dominated societies. Our third approach is to look at commercial and material cultural exchange through the lens of globalization and localization: we assess the changing vectors for exchange as well as how cultural items themselves moved and transformed. This sections peaks with a discussion of how historiography under the Mongols can serve as a proxy for multi-valent elite perspectives of global empire that were simultaneously localized to their sites of production. Last, we look at how Mongol political culture and imperial practice conditioned that of successor states. This course will be taught by Aaron Molnar."

It is also a portal to Chinese civilization. Encyclopedic in scope, this book both sums up Chinese culture and asks of it difficult questions. Its cult status also accounts for modern popular screen and television adaptations. Through a close examination of this text in conjunction with supplementary readings and visual materials, the seminar will explore a series of topics on Chinese culture, including foundational myths, philosophical and religious systems, the status of fiction, conceptions of art and the artist, ideas about love, desire and sexuality, gender roles, garden aesthetics, family and clan structure, and definitions of socio-political order."

From the 1910s-1930s stardom of silent-film narrators (pyŏnsa) in colonial Korea, to the global success of Korean stars in the fields of film, music, drama, fashion, and gaming today, this course will map the trajectories of modern and contemporary media culture in Korea—and beyond—with an emphasis on stars. We will develop the analytical capacities to probe the recurring themes a star consolidates within the specific historical contexts of Korea across a series of their works.

What are/were the epistemological and material vectors that constitute each word, and how do these vectors bridge the two terms, or conversely, bring them into them conflict? What specific modes of mapping the world have arisen from this combination? This undergraduate seminar sketches a trajectory of cinema as an art of formulating subjectivity in Korea, from the colonial period to the present. Bringing together multiple understandings of technology—in relation to mass media, natural science and engineering, and the operation of governmentality—we will probe how cinema has been a major site of technologies, a central node at which the fostering of pliant subjects for imperialism, authoritarianism, neoliberalism, and heteronormative male-centered society in general; the navigation and critique of these very power relations; and encounters with new science and mass media technologies all intersected in Korea. Instead of defining Korean cinema as the homogenous realization of some unchanging cultural essence of Korea, this seminar approaches it as a conjunction of diverse modes of addressing the subject's place within the changing techno-geopolitical, infrastructural, and ecological landscapes surrounding Korea. In tandem with an in-depth reading of each film's aesthetic and narrative features, we will examine the rationales behind the categorization of films as Joseon film, women's film, experimental film, Minjok film, Korean New Wave, and Korean blockbusters, to name a few, as proposed by film directors, critics, scholars, film societies, and government institutions. The focus of the seminar is placed on these cinematic genres' (1) approach to the medium of film, audience, and screening venue, (2) their resonance with social movements and theorizations of cinema abroad, (3) the convergence of film aesthetics and infrastructural changes (train, car, factory, etc.) and new media technologies (computer animation, VR, drone, GoPro, etc.), and (4) their frustration or consolidation of the national, ideological, gendered, and epochal boundaries propping up the notion of Korean. Building on these concerns, students are encouraged to explore the interplay of multiple technologies through which diverse forms of subjectivity are contested, questioned, and appropriated, and to respond to the central questions posed by the seminar in their final projects."

To what extent did the theorization of different literary arts involve a shared conceptual vocabulary? How should we understand the gaps between writerly theory and practice? How did literary identities intersect status identities? Did models of creativity from earlier periods shape early modern conceptions of authorship? Can we trace the role of readers and fans in the shaping the figure of the author? How should we understand the striking gender segregation apparent in early modern authorship? We will examine poetic treatises, author biographies, playwrighting manuals, works of fiction, visual representations of writers past and present, encyclopedias and theatrical ephemera, letters, and works of social history concerning status, selfhood, and labor.

Both remain living performance genres today. Yet studying them as forms of early modern theater proves daunting. Both forms have undergone significant changes since the end of the Edo period (as, indeed, they transformed across the centuries of Tokugawa rule). And because performance is, by nature, ephemeral, reconstructing the dynamics and experience of an early modern play presents significant challenges. This is particularly true in the case of kabuki: a form for which the script (few of which survive) served primarily as a general outline for performances that could change significantly from one showing to the next. Yet both theaters left a wide range of traces in diverse media: playbills, actor critiques, actor and theater prints, objects, book illustrations, and theater-related books of all varieties, from satirical audience critiques to adaptations of plays into illustrated print fiction (kusazōshi). This seminar has three aims. First, it will introduce students to practical methods for studying early modern performance: familiarizing them with archives of theatrical ephemera, introducing strategies for accessing elements of performance from secondary materials, studying accounts of playwriting and performance by early modern playwrights and actors, and weighing the pitfalls and rewards of relying upon the conventions of modern performances. Second, it will invite students to understand early modern theater not only as a matter of performance, but as a broader cultural phenomenon that most people accessed not within the playhouse, but through secondary media like playbills, prints, critiques, merchandise, and fiction. And third, the seminar will delve into broader cultural, social, and political dimensions of theater in the early modern period, touching on such subjects as the relationship between the theater and the sacred; the theater's relationship to early modern discourses of emotion; the body of the actor and the performance of gender; fan culture; the relationship between urban and rural theatrical culture; and the ongoing debate about whether early modern kabuki is better understood as a subversive or a conservative genre.

In the early days of the cold war, game theory was used to analyze an emerging nuclear arms race; today, it has applications in economics, psychology, politics, the law and other fields. In this course, we will explore the strategic way of thinking as developed by game theorists over the past sixty years. Special attention will be paid to the move from zero-sum to nonzero-sum game theory. Students will learn the basic solution concepts of game theory -- including minimax and Nash equilibrium -- by playing and analyzing games in class, and then we will take up some game-theoretic applications in negotiation settings: the strategic use of threats, bluffs and promises. We will also study the repeated prisoner's dilemma and investigate how cooperative behavior may emerge in a population of rational egoists. This problematic -- the evolution of cooperation -- extends from economics and political science to biology and artificial intelligence, and it presents a host of interesting challenges for both theoretical and applied research. Finally, we will consider the changing context for the development of game theory today, in particular, the need to achieve international cooperation on economic and environmental issues. The course has two main objective: to introduce students to the fundamental problems and solution concepts of noncooperative game theory; and to provide an historical perspective on its development, from the analysis of military conflicts to contemporary applications in economics and other fields.

How does mental health influence the economy? How do economic theory and econometrics illuminate, and obfuscate, the challenges of mental illness? Mental health has quickly become one of the most important topics in global policymaking. Yet the links between influential fields of social science – especially economics – and behavioral medicine remain underdeveloped. This course will first explore the frontier of concepts in psychopathology, including perspectives from rational choice theory which are both limiting and illuminating in the ongoing quest to characterize mental health and mental illness. The course will then turn to the social and economic drivers of mental health. From deaths of despair and the U.S. opioid epidemic, conspicuous consumption and income-wellbeing relationship, social media and American teen distress, and our general state of misery despite unprecedented material affluence, this course will systematically investigate the influences of society on mental health. Unlike most courses on mental health in other departments or medical schools, the syllabus will uncover unique empirical insights produced by the field of economics, and review in detail the econometric techniques used in these studies. Third, we will turn to the influences of mental health on society. We will consider extreme outcomes in housing markets such as homelessness and its relationship to severe mental illness. We examine classical approaches in economics to the housing market and homelessness, including new insights from behavioral health and transnational perspectives. Finally, we will turn to the roll of interventions. From pharmacotherapy, new interventional techniques (ECT, rTMS, ketamine), therapy, nutrition, and health system organization, ACT teams, supportive housing, we will consider potential and limitations in current societal responses to mental illness, using cross- national comparisons to illuminate the important differences in outcomes. We end with a consideration of the goals of economic policy, and examine how a focus on enhancing human mental wellbeing may offer unique opportunities in climate change and growth policy.

Nowadays, in the majority of markets, a handful of firms interact strategically and compete in numerous dimensions, including prices, products offered, advertising and investment. We will use formal models in order to address questions like: Why are markets organized the way they are? How does market organization affect firm behavior, such as firm production or pricing? How does the behavior of firms in turn affect the market structure? How does government policy shape firm behavior and market structure? What is the impact on welfare? Through the use of both theory and data, we will attempt to answer these questions.The course will proceed in three parts. We will first tackle decentralized markets; i.e. markets where many small firms compete in an ad hoc fashion (e.g. taxis, oceanic shipping, real estate). A recent and growing phenomenon in this setup is the emergence of platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, Uber Freight, Airbnb, etc. We will discuss their impact on markets and societal welfare. Then, we will introduce key concepts from the field of Industrial Organization in order to study oligopolistic markets. Through the use of models (mainly game theory) but also empirical analysis, we will explore the strategic interactions between firms and the impact of market power on society. Using these tools, we will study collusion and mergers. We will rely on game theory to analyze the strategic environment under study.Finally, we will study market power in global markets. In a strong recent trend, governments around the world are engaging in industrial policy (e.g. Made in China 2025). What are the rationales behind these initiatives? Are they effective? What is their impact on both domestic and global societal welfare? In this last part of the course we will focus on the role of governments in shaping global competition.The goal of this class is to get you engaged in topics of current interest and heated policy debates; what is market power and how does it affect the world?, how has uber changed transportation?, does industrial policy work? but also to get you to think about these questions through the rigorous lens of an economist armed with a good combination of formal modeling and empirical tools."

A major goal is to lay out a coherent argument that, for all its theoretical innovation, The General Theory did not deliver: the argument why a market system, even an idealized system with all of the warts removed, may fail to provide jobs for willing workers. In the process we will examine the orthodoxy that Keynes attacked and that resurfaced in the 1960s and 70s; the key concepts underlying the models implicit in The General Theory; and the attempts of the Keynesian mainstream to make peace with both Keynes and orthodoxy. We will also explore the applicability of The General Theory to the long run. A final section will view the present economic difficulties through a Keynesian lens.

It covers the period of early childhood, but discussion will often extend to older children and adults. The course will cover attachment, pretense and imagination, theory of mind/autism, language and thought, memory, moral development, emotion and emotion understanding, vocabulary growth, cross-cultural variation in relationships and thinking, trust in others' testimony, thinking and reasoning, and religious development. An important goal is to allow students to examine for themselves not just the conclusions that psychologists have reached about development but also some of the experiments and observations that have led to those conclusions.Learning Goals:The purpose of this course is to introduce you to theories and findings in developmental psychology. The main emphasis will be on early childhood – roughly the period from 18 months to 6 years but for some topics we will also discuss development through adulthood. An important goal is to introduce you to some of the major theorists in developmental psychology (e.g., Bowlby, Piaget, Vygotsky, Kohlberg) as well as more contemporary researchers.

For example, can psychology help to improve the way that we teach reading? Can it help to close the gap in achievement between particular groups? Do preschoolers have ideas or dispositions that help--or hinder--their progress in school? However, one can also ask about the effects of education on psychological processes. There is enormous cross-national and cross-cultural variation in the length and type of education that children receive. A major goal of this course is to help students understand the effects of such variation on the ways that people think--and feel. A secondary goal is to alert students to the ways in which those effects can be measured and to underline the contribution that different methods-- experiments, large-scale surveys, and participant observation--can make to our understanding of such effects. The final goal is to underline how educational provision and its impact vary dramatically across the globe. Learning Goals:There is enormous variation in the length and type of education that children receive. A major goal of this course is to help you think about and understand the effects of such variation on the way that children end up thinking - and the values they hold. A secondary goal is to alert you to the ways in which those effects can be measured and to underline the contribution that different methods - small-scale experiments, large surveys, qualitative and observational studies - can make to our understanding of such effects. The final goal is to underline how far educational provision and its impact have varied in the course of history and currently vary across the globe.Career Focus:This course is co-listed at HGSE and The Harvard Chan School of Public Health. It is designed for masters and doctoral level students from across the University who are interested in the design, testing, and implementation of innovative, science-based strategies to promote the healthy development of young children facing adversity.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences,EDST,125,Children with Learning and Developmental Differences,218922,2026 Spring,4,Mon,10:00 AM,12:00 PM,,Social Sciences,Instructor Permission Required,"Nadine Gaab The duration of education is a strong predictor of health and longevity, but approximately 1 in 5 children with learning or attention issues have long-lasting negative consequences related to their academic, social, mental health, vocational, economic outcomes. In the US, over 2 million students struggle with specific learning disabilities (SLD), which represents roughly 35% of all students who receive special education services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Children with a learning disability are less likely to complete high school or enroll in postsecondary educational programs and have a heightened risk for developing mental health problems such as depression or anxiety. Currently, SLDs are primarily identified and addressed within the education system; however, these students also receive care and support outside of school and are members of various community settings. A streamlined approach that informs the coordination of general education, special education, clinical psychology, policymaking, advocacy, caregivers, and health professionals (e.g., pediatricians, speech-and language pathologists) is often absent and hinders the design of preventive approaches, identification strategies, and service implementation. It further leads to a siloed approach for care and policymaking, lack of community supports.The course will provide a broad overview of learning disabilities and differences, including dyslexia, dyscalculia, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental language disorder, and autism spectrum disorder, as well as the relevant policies and educational documentation for these learners. It will then cover the professional stakeholders that should be involved in an evidence-based response to a learning difference, and identify their unique knowledge base, toolset, developmental timeline, and communication strategies, both in the educational/professional environment and the community. Finally, we will focus on barriers and challenges faced by children with learning differences in the academic, professional, and community settings. Throughout the course, students will be provided with both research/evidence-based content and case-based learning opportunities, practical examples, and guest speakers drawn from the community. Class activities will include both synchronous and asynchronous learning activities led by the Instructor (Prof. Nadine Gaab), along with breakout sessions overseen by the instructor and/or Teaching Fellows.This course is divided into thirds and will cover: (1) a broad overview of learning disabilities, educational policies, and service documentation; (2) stakeholders in academic and professional settings, including their unique knowledge base, toolset, developmental timeline, and communication strategies, barriers faced by children with learning differences in these settings, existing solutions to these barriers; and (3) stakeholders in community settings, barriers faced by individuals with learners in these settings, existing solutions to these challenges."

This course introduces students to the origins, epistemologies, frameworks, key concepts, and central questions in the field and community of Ethnic Studies, while applying these concepts and questions to our own educational experiences and the various contexts that we navigate. The course begins with an examination and analysis of self and impact of dominant and counter narratives throughout history, which will provide a foundation for the second half of the course when we examine more recent histories and issues faced by communities of color, including the ongoing struggle for Ethnic Studies here at Harvard. Topics will include, but are not limited to: settler colonialism, race, racism, ethnicity, migration, labor, colonialism, social movements, oppression, intergenerational trauma and resilience, white supremacy, power, agency, liberation, intersectionality, community action, healing centered engagement, solidarity, and social change. This course is designed to be both an individual and collective journey that challenges each of us to critically reflect upon what it means to authentically exercise solidarity in ways that actively interrupt oppression and humanize all participants in classrooms, communities, and beyond."

In fact, it marks the largest growth period in human development outside of infancy. Driven by enhanced thinking and reasoning capabilities, adolescents struggle with balancing their desires for autonomy andindependence with their desires for guidance and connection. These dynamics result in renegotiating family and social relationships and engagement in school, impact the effectiveness of educational practices, and enhance adolescents' ability to think and plan for their future. This course is designed to provide a practical understanding of the developmental issues, assets, and trajectories of adolescent thinking and reasoning. Based in classic and current theory and research and using real problems of practice, students will learn, integrate, and apply knowledge of biological and cognitive development and of identity processes. This course will prepare educational practitioners to integrate developmental approaches to their pedagogy and provide a foundation for those interested in applied research on adolescence.No prerequisites; prior course work in developmental psychology is helpful, but the course is designed for students without a psychology background. Recommended for students who are planning to work directly with adolescents or are planning to engage in applied research with adolescents."

When immersed in our own educational experiences and cultural backgrounds, we easily overlook cross-cultural variation and inaccurately generalize our own experiences to people in different cultures. It is therefore important to adopt a comparative approach and examine how people think about and practice education in different cultures. This not onlyallows us to appreciate cross-cultural diversity and universalities, but also prompts us to reflect on how we are influenced by our own cultural backgrounds.In this course, students will examine the educational beliefs and practices in Western and East Asian cultures. Specifically, students will compare Western and East Asian cultures with respect to their cultural values, education in the family context, and education in the school context.This course is designed to help students achieve the following learning goals:1. Understand the diversity in how people think about and practice education in Western and East Asian cultures,2. Reflect on potential universal aspects in human development and education across cultures and develop a nuanced and reflective approach to understanding culture, and3. Critically examine your own educational experiences and communicate, empathize, and learn with people from different backgrounds."

It can offer an alternative perspective on learning principles, skill development, and learning differences including their underlying etiologies. However, the role of this body of knowledge for developing pedagogical principles, interventions, or public policy, has been debated. Furthermore, this knowledge is often translated into educational contexts, inefficaciously leading to overgeneralizations, myths, and ineffective practices harming students. In this course, students will be introduced to the brain's structure and function, how the it brain changes over time, and the methods used to study the brain and its development and plasticity. Students will further identify and dispel common brain myths in educational contexts and learn to evaluate scientific evidence and approaches related to brain development and 'brain training' programs. Students will then learn about specific domains of development critical in educational contexts, including the acquisition of language, reading and math skills, attention, emotions, social interactions, and how environmental factors can alter developmental trajectories. Students will review both the typical developmental pattern experienced by most children and specific developmental differences and disabilities relevant in educational contexts. The course has a strong translational component and includes specific practical applications of the course content to challenges and demands in educational contexts and policy, which is reflected in the assessments. Class activities will consist of both synchronous and asynchronous learning activities led by the instructor."

Designed for researchers and practitioners, this course focuses on the pressing issues related to bilingual students' language and literacy instruction. The term bilingual in this course will be used to refer to a variety of students who have diverse and unequal experiences in more than one language and who speak or hear a language different from the societal language at home, but who might receive bilingual or monolingual instruction at school. The course employs an interdisciplinary perspective, drawing on sociocultural, psycho-linguistic, and educational frameworks of research conducted in the United States and in various international contexts. A number of societal factors related to language, literacy, and academic achievement will be explored: the many modes of being bilingual or multilingual, the role of linguistic minorities in society, the role of educational resources, and the impact of educational policies on bilingual populations. The course will provide opportunities to discuss and investigate the literacy development of bilingual learners, reflect on the important contribution of literacy skills to academic achievement, and learn and reflect about research-based instructional approaches.This course is intended for students who anticipate working with linguistically diverse populations as practitioners, policymakers, or researchers. Engineering Sciences Engineering Sciences ENG-SCI 20R Physics of Sports Kelly Miller This project-based course will introduce the physical concepts that can be applied to various human athletic endeavors. Students will focus on analyzing the dynamics of a specific sport/ physical activity through a project that they develop. This will allow students to construct physical models with an increasing level of realism that can used to analyze sporting events. Mathematics is the language of physics, and its use will be ever-present throughout the semester.

ENG-SCI 26 Humanity and its Futures: AI and Human Cognition Fawwaz Habbal This course provides students with an understanding of the complexities surrounding today's most intractable problems and helps them develop methodologies for navigating the challenges they will face. After introducing systems thinking, with a focus on interconnections and feedback loops, the course will address a significant interdisciplinary issue: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its relationship to human cognition.The study of AI and human cognition is both timely and dynamic. This expansive domain integrates computer science, statistics, big data, cognitive science, psychology, and philosophy. As a transformative technology, AI has achieved remarkable success in understanding natural language and emulating human reasoning, making it invaluable in augmenting human cognition.Despite these advances, many questions remain about the nature of AI and its relationship with human thought. This course invites participants to explore these questions through an intellectual journey. Students will engage in discussions on systems and paradigms, the essence of intelligence, computational approaches, mind and machine metaphors, cognitive biases in AI, and the role of AI in creativity and intuition.The course emphasizes collaborative learning, with students working in teams to learn from each other, as well as from lectures and selected literature. Each lecture will be paired with research papers and books, followed by a discussion session.The topics covered in the course are listed in the syllabus. Each will include an overview of the issue and its significance. Students will apply systems thinking and a multidisciplinary approach to analyze and critique each topic. By the end of the course, students will have developed a strong framework for multidisciplinary discussions, gained a deep understanding of AI's power, limitations, and risks, and explored its technical building blocks through hands-on exercises. Additionally, students will experience the value of collaboration and the importance of diversity while working in diverse teams. The combined cap for ES 26 and ES 294 is 25 students. ENG-SCI 30 Startups: From Idea to Exit Josh Lerner, Spencer Rascoff This course explores the stages of a startup business, from idea generation through its scaling stage through its eventual exit. Students will learn how to assess a startup idea, how to raise capital, how to grow teams, how to manage the company through adversity, and how to successfully sell a company. Based on two acclaimed courses at Harvard Business School – Launching Tech Ventures and Scaling Tech Ventures – the class is half lecture and half panel discussion and student presentations. Classes will draw from Professor Rascoff's extensive startup experience (Zillow, Hotwire, Pacaso, Match Group) and several industry experts will join the class sessions. ENG-SCI 50 Introduction to Electrical Engineering Marko Loncar The main course objectives are to introduce students to the exciting and powerful world of electrical engineering and to explain how gadgets that we use every day actually work.

ENG-SCI 201 Decision Theory Demba Ba ES 201/AM 231 is a course in statistical inference and estimation from a signal processing perspective. The course will emphasize the entire pipeline from writing a model, estimating its parameters and performing inference utilizing real data. The first part of the course will focus on linear and nonlinear probabilistic generative/regression models (e.g. linear, logistic, Poisson regression), and algorithms for optimization (ML/MAP estimation) and Bayesian inference in these models. We will play particular attention to sparsity-induced regression models, because of their relation to artificial neural networks, the topic of the second part of the course. The second part of the course will introduce students to the nascent and exciting research area of model-based deep learning. At present, we lack a principled way to design artificial neural networks, the workhorses of modern AI systems. Moreover, modern AI systems lack the ability to explain how they reach their decisions. In other words, we cannot yet call AI explainable or interpretable which, as a society, poses important questions as to the responsible use of such technology. Model-based deep learning provides a framework to develop and constrain neural-network architectures in a principled fashion. We will see, for instance, how neural- networks with ReLU nonlinearites arise from sparse probabilistic generative models introduced in the first part of the course. This will form the basis for a rigorous recipe we will teach you to build interpretable deep neural networks, from the ground up. We will invite an exciting line up of speakers.

ENG-SCI 292A Launch Lab/Capstone 1 Russell J Wilcox, Alan Maccormack The MS/MBA Capstone is an intensive project that requires teams of students to apply and integrate the skills they have learned across core disciplines developed in the program curriculum. Specifically, teams will be expected to design, build and launch a new technology-based product/service venture, and thereby to demonstrate mastery with respect to three areas of knowledge: Design Knowledge: The use of human-centered design methods to understand users, identify solutions to their needs, and gather feedback via rapid, iterative prototyping. Technical Knowledge: The use of rigorous system engineering methods to plan, design, develop, build, and test a complex technology-based product/service, integrating knowledge across multiple engineering disciplines. Business Knowledge: The use of business model analysis and lean experimentation methods to develop and test a set of hypotheses that capture how the new product/service will create value, including business model design, pricing, sales and marketing, operating model and profit formula.The Capstone is divided into two parts, the first of which is an immersive course completed during the January term of the G2 year (Capstone I). The subsequent spring course (Capstone II) follows on from and builds upon work completed in January. Given students prior coursework, a working knowledge of human-centered design methods, systems engineering techniques, and business modeling and lean experimentation is assumed. Launch Lab therefore focuses on the practical application of these skills to team projects, supplemented by content in three areas: i) seminars on advanced methods and techniques, ii) workshops that demonstrate how to put these skills and tools into practice, and iii) guest speakers who share their experience in the areas of design, technology and business.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences,ENGLISH,CAKN,Fiction Workshop: The Short Novel,226477,2025 Fall,4,,,,,,Instructor Permission Required,"Andrew Krivak This course is a workshop intended for students who are interested in exploring the form of the short novel, or the novella. The short novel is not simply a novel with fewer pages. The short novel understands and develops character and conflict, time and plot, and often setting and stage in ways unique to its particular scope, characters, and intent. We will read seven short novels in this course: Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (to be read before the first meeting); Norman Maclean's A River Runs Through It; Annie Ernaux's Happening; Denis Johnson's Train Dreams; Claire Keegan's Small Things Like These; Jon Fosse's Aliss at the Fire; and Juan Rulfo's Pedro Páramo. Separately and collectively, we will ask of these works: What is the form, and how is the form realized in the arc of the narrative? Primarily, however, students will write. Our goal will be to have a student's work read and discussed twice in class during the semester. I am hoping to see 40 to 50 pages of a short novel —at any level of completion—by the end of term. Admission by application only. For information on specific application requirements and instructions, please see the full course listing on the English Department website. DEADLINE: for all Fall 2025 workshops, applications will open by March 24 and are due via Submittable by 11:59pm on Sunday, April 6.

What can poetry reveal about the ways our interior selves are shaped by public realities like race, class, sexuality, injustice and more? And what can vigilant attention to craft do to inform and enhance such considerations?This course will proceed as part seminar, part workshop.

In the first hour of each class, we will be doing close readings/literary- critical analyses of an assigned text (see below, 'Course Schedule', for all the reading material for the semester), with the aim of isolating some aspect of the craft of writing in order to take bearings for your own. We will be looking at technical things such as point of view, free indirect discourse, narration, character, interiority, style, movement, affect, but also at broader issues: metaphysics, politics, inequality, race, colonialism/imperialism, the white gaze. You will not only have read the assigned text with critical rigor but also taken notes of the points you want to raise in class. While I do not expect you to hand in short critical essays on the texts, I will be looking for engaged, alert discussions, so it may help to have something written down to facilitate our conversations. Please note: Reading the assigned text is obligatory. Previous Creative Writing workshop experience is desirable. If you' re writing YA fantasy, there are other courses on offer that would be a better fit.In the second half of the class, divided into two equal segments of 55 minutes each, we will be workshopping the writing of two students. To this end, every week two students will hand in something they have written, to the tune of 2,500-5,000 words, to me and to everyone in the group, ideally one week before their turn. At our first meeting, I will circulate a rota for you to put down your names and walk you through the syllabus, the aims and objectives of the course, workshop rules, expectations, requirements etc. For our first workshopping session, two students should hand in work five to seven days before. Our goal is for each of you to have two turns, and approximately 5-10,000 words of your work critiqued, by the time semester ends. Copies of these writing samples will be returned to you at the end of each workshop with comments from me and from everyone in class. Work submitted must be single-sided, double-spaced, paginated and, ideally, bearing a title.

That character on the page is just this shaving off of the person that was within a very particular context, intermingled with bits of perspective from all the time since — it's a very specific little cocktail of pieces of the self and memory and art … it's a very weird thing. And then it's frozen in the pages. With each essay and work of nonfiction we produce in this workshop-based class, the character we portray, the narrator we locate, is never stagnant, instead we are developing a persona, wrought from the experience of our vast selves and our vast experiences. To that end, in this course, you will use the tools and stylistic elements of creative nonfiction, namely fragmentation, narrative, scene, point of view, speculation, and research to remix and retell all aspects of your experience and selfhood in a multiplicity of ways. I will ask that you focus on a particular time period or connected events, and through the course of the semester, you will reimagine and reify these events using different modes and techniques as modeled in the published and various works we read. We will also read, in their entireties, Melissa Febos's Body Work: The Radical Work of Personal Narrative, as well as Hanif Abdurraqib's They Can't Kill Us Until They Kill Us, which will aid our discussions and help us to better understand the difference between persona(s) and the many versions of self that inhabit us."

The body of the course looks to the great literary types, or modes, such as epic, tragedy, and lyric, as well as to the workings of literary style in moments of historical change, producing the transformation, recycling, and sometimes the mocking of past forms. While each version of English 20 includes a different array of genres and texts from multiple periods, those texts will always include five major works from across literary history: Beowulf (epic), The Winter's Tale (tragicomedy or romance), Persuasion (comic novel), The Souls of Black Folk (essays; expository prose), and Elizabeth Bishop's poems (lyric). The course integrates creative writing with critical attention: assignments will take creative as well as expository and analytical forms. is a limited enrollment course which will prioritize sophomores and first-years; juniors and seniors who want to take it as an elective will be considered for any remaining spots.

The second half of Shakespeare's career (1601-1611) includes such magnificent plays as Othello, King Lear, Macbeth, Antony and Cleopatra, Coriolanus, and The Tempest. His style becomes more gnarly and tough, more expressive and free. His view of human character becomes harsher, yet his vision of love grows deeper. The course ends with The Tempest, Shakespeare's magical farewell to the stage. Shakespeare's art will be explored through performance of scenes. There are fascinating film versions of these and other late plays, including a version of Hamlet set in New York City, where the To be or not to be speech is left on a telephone answering machine. In this course we examine how for us today, as in Shakespeare's own time, what we think of as Shakespeare's plays is the result of interaction between what was written on the page and what was performed on the stage—or, in our case, in film versions. Final projects for this seminar will involve taking an individual play and comparing the text with two film versions.

Bishop's critique of received ideas about nationality, race, power, gender, sexual orientation, and the overlap between culture and nature, connects with her cosmopolitanism: she has links to Canada, the U.S, and Brazil. Others refers to how her writing considers the sociopolitical reality of other people, and also to the comparisons we'll draw between her writing and that of other poets.

In other words, our investigation will be organized according to conventional sci fi genres of slipstream, alien contact, and apocalypse, but also to non-genre expressions of Indigenous futurity. By juxtaposing literary works from authors writing both within the boundaries of the United States and beyond, we will be able to make connections between them that highlight both their common sovereignty struggles and shared utopian visions, but also keeps in view the many meaningful differences in how Native American and Indigenous aesthetic productions perform the work of future- making.

From its inception, however, Harvard's endowment included Native lands expropriated through war, theft, and coercion. Drawing inspiration from Harvard's own Legacy of Slavery initiative and the Land-Grab Universities website, this class will conduct original research on Harvard's long history of involvement with Native communities and Native lands. We will work hands-on with archives at Harvard and other area institutions, developing research skills in navigating collections, reading early handwriting, and interpreting colonial documents. Readings and class activities will engage New England colonialism, the long history of Indigenous dispossession and resistance, and the political struggles of Indigenous communities today. We will closely examine texts including poems, speeches, oral narratives, maps, short stories, and deeds, exploring the centrality of land and environment in colonial and Indigenous histories and literatures. In the second half of our class, we will work collaboratively to design and execute group or individual research projects. Previous iterations of this course in Fall 2022 and Fall 2023 gathered data on Harvard's land transactions and resulted in a set of student-driven research projects on sites, properties, and individuals connected to Harvard's Indigenous pasts; our research will build on that work.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences,ENGLISH,90LV,Consciousness in Fiction from Austen to Woolf,118850,2025 Fall,4,,,,,Arts and Humanities,Instructor Permission Required,"James Wood In this seminar, we look at the ways in which a range of writers represent the mind on the page: the mind at thought, in agitation, at rest, at prayer, in distress, in rebellion, and just doing nothing (or apparently nothing). This examination allows us to scrutinize just over a hundred years of novelistic development and experiment – from 1813 to 1927, from Jane Austen to Virginia Woolf – a period that might rightly be considered the high-point of the novel's rise. We will discover that as the novelistic treatment of consciousness changes, so the idea of what a mind (or a self) is, also changes: the form (the means of representation) modifies the content (what is represented). What might seem at first like a fairly small thing – a question of novelistic technique – will turn out to have massive and far-reaching consequences for our sense of self. Writers studied: Austen, Flaubert, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, Fontane, Woolf.

From the heroic poems of the ancient Near East to modern films of quest and adventure, epic speaks to the shared values and collective aspirations of cultures, peoples, and communities. But if its formal conventions and thematic interests endure, epic changes over time. In this course, you will study the historical and literary evolution of epic as it moves from oral verse into new genres and media, reading texts from the ancient Mediterranean alongside works of poetry, fiction, and cinema from early modern Britain, twentieth-century America, and the contemporary Global South. We will look at some texts in their entirety and others in extracts, focusing on Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Vergil' s Aeneid, Milton's Paradise Lost, Derek Walcott's Omeros, The Mahabharata (in prose and film versions), and George Lucas' Star Wars, with detailed analysis of Gwendolyn Brooks's American epics on Black life, Annie Allen and In the Mecca. If issues of identity, belonging, and community have always been explored in epic, what is the place of epic in a pluralist multi-culture? What are our contemporary epics today?"
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,ENGLISH,115B,Chaucer: The Canterbury Tales,146214,2025 Fall,4,,,,,None,,"Anna Wilson What makes stories so pleasurable and revealing but also so enraging and dangerous? How are we to think about the strong emotions they evoke and learn to resist as well as appreciate their power? This course revisits Geoffrey Chaucer's classic fourteenth-century poem, The Canterbury Tales: the deepest and most caustically entertaining analysis of storytelling ever written. The Canterbury Tales consists of a series of tales told by members of a pilgrimage on their way from London to Canterbury, representatives of the internally divided social world of Chaucer's England. Some are serious, others funny, obscene, or offensive; some are religious, others not at all; some deal with issues local to England, others range across the Europe and the rest of the known world; many are told against other pilgrims. Written in a long-ago past, the poem jumps off the page, in turns unrecognisably weird and startlingly modern. We read the poem in the language in which it was written, Middle English, easy and fun to learn with early help: no previous experience with the language, or with the medieval era, is necessary. We will also explore the poem's long-ranging impact on English literature, including several contemporary reimaginings. Classes include a short lecture on a tale, and class discussion, which continues in weekly sections. Course projects include an essay, a collaborative report on one tale, and a creative option. Students of all years and from all concentrations and programs are welcome. If you are a graduate student interested in taking this class, please contact Prof. Wilson to indicate interest before term begins; there may be an additional graduate section if there is sufficient demand.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences,ENGLISH,148,Modern Monsters in Literature and Film,130892,2025 Fall,4,,,,,Arts and Humanities,,"Deidre Lynch Why study monsters? Though modern peoples don't fear monsters and indeed don't even believe in them (or so we tell ourselves), monsters have nonetheless done an awfully good job of colonizing twenty-first-century popular culture. At present marauding vampires and the walking dead are everywhere (and then, too, there are the internet trolls). Our world seems to dedicate a lot of energy to exactly the fears we thought we were supposed either to have exorcised by becoming modern and disenchanted or to have exorcised simply by growing up and no longer needing to look under our beds before falling asleep at night. Why does the monstrous compel us? To help explain the fascination with the monster, this course looks backward, to nineteenth-century Gothic fiction and to the horror cinema that took up its mantle. The course's premise is that by taking seriously monsters' staying power we can learn a lot--about, for instance, the way the horror tradition has helped modernity make sense of itself. Monster stories are stories about the failures built into our systems of categorization and notions of normality. They make vivid the potential for violence in the notions of cultural purity and cultural inheritance that modernity uses to organize its accounts of identity and community. We'll begin in the year 1818 with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Our next move will be to the fictions that were written in the shadow of that famous ghost-story competition that on a dark and stormy night ushered into being both Shelley's monster and (via the poet Lord Byron and his traveling companion John Polidori) the first modern vampire. Pursuit of this project will have us reading novels, novellas, and short stories by Sheridan Le Fanu, Bram Stoker, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Robert Louis Stevenson, Gaston Leroux, H.G. Wells, and others. We'll turn briefly near the end of the semester to the early horror films that gave the Gothic tradition's recurring preoccupations with the animation of the dead a new lease on life. Bringing the story of the class up to the present, we'll conclude the semester with some episodes of Ben Stiller's Apple TV show Severance.

Focusing on John Keats (his key poems, and his key ideas, about negative capability, the camelion poet, and so on), this course makes unconventional connections into the twentieth, and twenty-first century. Tracking issues of race, class, gender and sexuality, we'll bounce from Keats into war verse; African-American poetries; world/postcolonial writing; the literature of social class; feminist experimentalism; and constructions of masculinity. Concentrators will learn how to analyze poetry in both closed and open forms. This course satisfies the 1700-1900 Guided Elective requirement for English concentrators and Secondary Field students."

Yeats (1865-1939) left us a matchless body of lyric and dramatic verse, including love poems, political meditations, ballads, prophetic warnings, palinodes, and rewritten myths. He also wrote and co-wrote transcribed folktales, novels, literary criticism, memoir, political speeches, records of mystical visions, and tens of thousands of letters; promoted Irish culture; ran a theatre company; won a Nobel prize; stood against empire and theocracy (but in favor of aristocracy); and changed his mind when he knew he was wrong. We will read all his major poems and other works, with attention to their composition, along with some rivals, friends and contemporaries in Ireland and beyond; we will also look at critical traditions around him.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences,ENGLISH,173BL,The Black Lyric,218755,2026 Spring,4,,,,,Arts and Humanities,,"Tracy K. Smith African American poets have long embraced the private freedoms of the lyric poem—freedom to claim the authority of an uncontested first person I; freedom to wrangle language into new and startling forms; freedom to depart as needed from the strictures of linear reality. And yet, from its earliest iterations, African American poetry has also concerned itself with correcting and complicating the official narrative of Black life and Black subjectivity in America. This course will explore the means by which Black poets have innovated upon the lyric tradition to accommodate a sense of allegiance to a collective. In this tradition, the lyric poem has become a powerful tool with which to ponder the dynamics of self and other, intimate and political—and justice and injustice. Course readings will include work by seminal 20th Century American figures such as Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, Robert Hayden and Lucille Clifton, as well as contemporary voices like Jericho Brown, Tyehimba Jess, Morgan Parker, Eve L. Ewing and others. We will also devote attention to lyric corollaries in film, music, visual art and performance.

They lived thirty years and thirty miles apart, met only once over a period of some days, and wrote long, completely different books, both inspired by what they understood as visionary encounters with the divine. Julian was a Christian intellectual, a brilliant writer, intensely visual but also abstract, who spent a lifetime writing and rewriting an intricate and optimistic analysis of how to live as an aspiring and suffering human being in the world that many people around the world still live by. Margery (she did not much like her husband's name) was a religious experimentalist, devout globe-trotter and performance artist, equally brilliant, whose energies seemed to have gone into living more than writing, but who in old age dictated then revised what many understand as the first English autobiography. After being mostly ignored for several hundred years, they are now being read with care, although by different readerships and in different ways. It is time they were brought together again.In this discussion-based course, we read Julian of Norwich's Revelation of Love and The Book of Margery Kempe alongside one another, as well as in the light other women writers who drew inspiration from visions, revelations, or dreams, from the early Christian martyr Perpetua of Carthage in the third century CE to the reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson in the nineteenth. We pay particular attention to Julian and Margery's direct precursors, Angela of Foligno, Gertrude the Great, and Marguerite Porete, among others. We consider how it was that revelations were able to make an innovative, demanding and prestigious mode of thought and writing possible for women who were excluded by their gender from the formal education available to male contemporaries. We think about what revelations are, how they function as an embodied, kinetic, and dialogic mode of consciousness, and the stylistic and intellectual experimentation this mode of consciousness enables. We speculate on potential connections between the visionary and other non- natural ways of seeing the world. Finally, we consider the excruciating difficulty of being and writing as a visionary and the cultural and psychic pressures the role of visionary involved and involves. Although the main setting of the course is the world of Julian and Margery, we do not forget that we are reading them in the now. including PhD students in English (please contact me for enrolment details).

How do we write about them? In this course, we will visit four major metropolises around the world: London, Bombay, New York, and Seoul. We will focus primarily on one narrative work set in each of these cities—Charles Dickens's Bleak House, Suketu Mehta' s Maximum City, Teju Cole's Open City, and Hwang Sok Young's At Dusk—and supplement our reading with short stories, journalism, sociology, movies, and television by writers and directors including: Zadie Smith, Micaela Coel, Edith Wharton, James Baldwin, Katherine Boo, Spike Lee and Bong Joon-Ho."
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,ENGLISH,185E,The Essay: History and Practice,207555,2026 Spring,4,,,,,Arts and Humanities,,"James Wood Matthew Arnold famously said that poetry is, at bottom, a criticism of life. But if any literary form is truly a criticism of life, it is the essay. And yet despite the fact that all students write essays, most students rarely study them; bookshops and libraries categorize such work only negatively, by what it is not: non-fiction. At the same time, the essay is at present one of the most productive and fertile of literary forms. It is practiced as memoir, reportage, diary, criticism, and sometimes all four at once. Novels are becoming more essayistic, while essays are borrowing conventions and prestige from fiction. This class will disinter the essay from its comparative academic neglect, and examine the vibrant contemporary borderland between the reported and the invented. We will study the history of the essay, from Montaigne to the present day. Rather than study that history purely chronologically, each class will group several essays from different decades and centuries around common themes: death, detail, sentiment, race, gender, photography, the city, witness, and so on. In addition to writing about essays – writing critical essays about essays – students will also be encouraged to write their own creative essays: we will study the history of the form, and practice the form itself. Essayists likely to be studied: Plutarch, Montaigne, Hazlitt, De Quincey, Woolf, Benjamin, Orwell, Camus, Primo Levi, Barthes, Baldwin, Sontag, Dyer, Didion, Leslie Jamison, Knausgaard, Ta-Nehisi Coates.

Drawing on video game scholars—Melissa Kagen, Brendan Keogh, Ian Bogost—we'll examine the gendered deconstruction of horror-codes in Gone Home (described by Brigid Kennedy as an explicitly queer videogame with an explicitly queer narrative); the interplay between the singular and the shareable in the trans micro-narrative, Dys4ia; and consider how Return of the Obra Dinn uses retrospective plotting to query a purely economic view of the world. We'll also discuss Firewatch, The Stanley Parable, Stray and Stardew Valley among other games, and consider how this art form, better than any other, probes the division identified by Theodor Adorno within capitalist society, separating work from leisure, or play. At the Bok Center Learning Lab, you'll sample games on multiple platforms and discover tools for creating game stories (engines like Unity, input devices, and storyboards)."

This class explores texts that are in conversation with others: adaptation, translation, fanfiction, parody, pastiche, and the remix. We will think about the role of form, genre, and media in adaptation, the decisions involved in transposing a story from novel to screen or stage, from oral storytelling to the printed page to digital archive, across times, contexts, languages, and audiences. Texts/movies discussed include fairytales, The Great Gatsby, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, and Arrival. We will also consider the legal frameworks, technologies, cultural institutions, and audience expectations that constrain adaptation: what is the nature of authorship? How much can a person own a text, or a character? How far can an adaptation go before audiences no longer recognize, or reject, an adaptation? What economic and cultural roles do adaptations play in our contemporary media landscape? The final assignment will include the option to create your own adaptation using some of the critical models we have explored. This is a lecture and discussion class accessible to non-concentrators."

The commercial success of Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf has given it a prominence in the general reading public the poem has rarely if ever enjoyed. At the same time its popularization at the hands of a self-described interloper has created a certain amount of anxiety among scholars of Old English. Our weekly discussions will include issues of translation while we compare our in-class efforts with Heaney's and with other versions that have been published over the years. We will also consider Heaney's translation on its own merits as a poem and in relation to the body of poetry he produced over his lifetime.

First, is criticism an art? Is literary criticism a practical or a theoretical enterprise? Does criticism combine philosophy and history while remaining separate from each (as Aristotle thought)? In what ways can criticism draw illuminating connections between a poet's work and a poet's life? What kind of attention can criticism pay to language, meter, genre, and literary history? Above all, what is the relation of criticism to the political and of the political to the aesthetic? Milton criticism over three centuries provides a unique archive for considering how criticism has been practiced over time. We follow the development from classic criticism (Marvell, Johnson, Voltaire, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Hazlitt, Blake, Equiano, Wollstonecraft, Arnold, Raleigh) to modern ones (Woolf, Eliot, Lewis, Empson, Frye, Schwartz, Quint, Greenblatt, Nyquist, Jameson, Wilburn, Mohamed, Lewalski, Vendler)."

We read these works through a late-medieval Aristotelian understanding of the imagination as a fundamental but fallible instrument of human perception, observing how they respond to traditions of writing about dreams, visions, and journeys to heaven or hell that go back to classical and Christian antiquity, in which human cognition and the shape of the cosmos are thought about very differently. We consider the inter- relationship between the poetic and the visionary in light of the categories of orthodoxy and discretion of spirits, at a period when both were fiercely contested. We also consider visionary writing and the contradictory claims it makes for the truth of intense imaginative experience as a precursor of the ubiquitous but puzzling modern concept of fiction, with special early reference to W. G. Sebald's 2001 novel Austerlitz. Texts not written in English will be read mainly in translation; no previous knowledge of Middle English, or of medieval visionary writing, is required. contact Prof. Watson before classes begin if you would like to take the course.

In this seminar, we will explore the ways a large-scale and oftentimes cosmic vision of existence is housed within Clifton's range of concerns and her use of familiar vernaculars.

And as aids to our collective theorizing, we'll derive resources from artists' books (e.g. those created by Stéphane Mallarmé, Angela Lorenz, and Tia Blassingame) and from fiction that calls attention to its own physical platform (e.g. Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy, Ling Ma's Severance, and Heike Geissler's Seasonal Associate)."
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,ENGLISH,299WC,Wild Criticism,226473,2026 Spring,4,,,,,,Instructor Permission Required,"Vidyan Ravinthiran Beginning with Oscar Wilde, who suggested in 1891 that the primary aim of the critic is to see the object as in itself it really is not, this course shows today's debates over creative criticism and postcriticism to have a long history. We'll consider, in particular, writers who quote other writers at length—close reading them—but in nonplussing, counterintuitive, even shocking ways. Monica Youn and William Empson, for instance, read John Milton against the grain; Pierre Bayard returns to Agatha Christie's Who Killed Roger Ackroyd? and suggests another solution to its murder mystery; Adam Phillips reimagines Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener as a tale about an eating disorder. W.E.B. Du Bois, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov and Anne Carson all write major works that are also experiments with the rhetorics of literary criticism. Which all raises the question: how should we write about books now? Students taking this course will author wild criticism of their own, moving across and into and through and between texts in adventurous ways."

Decarbonizing private transportation is essential to achieving climate goals, with transportation overall representing 28% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. EV sales are now growing rapidly: in 2022, battery electric vehicles (EVs) represented about 22% of new vehicle sales in China, 15% in the EU and 5% in the U.S. Forecasts suggest EVs will represent close to 50% of new vehicle sales in the U.S. by 2030 and higher in China and Europe. The EV transition has far-reaching repercussions from emissions to macroeconomic impacts to national security and poses substantial challenges in the rapid development of new supply chains. In this seminar, we will study the intersection of EVs, the energy transition, environmental science, policy, and economics. The current pace of change is dramatic but has roots going back 50 years to early U.S. environmental regulation and efforts to reduce dependency on Middle East oil; auto has been a critical element in trade policy back to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Policy is pivotal today, in the U.S. and overseas, in terms of determining the pace of EV adoption, how supply chains develop, and how fast they evolve. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) enables faster EV adoption through tax credits for EV production and purchases. Technological progress, especially in battery technology, will be critical in the path forward. We will analyze a range of EV issues including those highlighted above as well as charging, health impacts, equity, and international market differences."

The drivers of these trends in food security and malnutrition that are highlighted by international aid agencies are conflict, economic shocks, and climate extremes. In this course we will inquire, specifically, into linkages among climate change, extreme weather events, agricultural production, and food insecurity, and also consider the broader context of how conflict, socioeconomic, and health conditions may be susceptible to extreme weather and influence the ability to mitigate and adapt to changes in extreme weather. The answer to this inquiry is important: insomuch as climate change is a fundamental driver of recent decreases in food security, the almost inevitable continued changes in climate in the coming decades are of major concern for food security going forward. Moreover, identification of the specific pathways by which climate change influences food security is critical for devising appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures. We will cover how variations in temperature, water, and sunlight influence crop yield; how exposure to these environmental variations alters under climate change; connections between food production shocks and food insecurity; and the degree to which changes in food security can be predicted. Individual classes will be organized around academic papers encompassing distinct viewpoints, and through reading, discussion, and hearing from outside speakers. We will, as a class, seek some overall understanding of the drivers of food insecurity and how these can, at least in principle, be addressed."

The central objective of the New Climate Observatory is to address this problem by introducing, for the first time, the development of a new generation of innovative technology that takes explicit advantage of recent major advances in Harvard-based instruments and optical designs in combination with advanced solar powered stratospheric aeronautical design. The new solar powered stratospheric aircraft that together constitute the Climate Observatory engage multiple recent design innovations in photovoltaics, energy storage, as well as guidance and control. Together these enable a combination of long duration solar powered observing systems, each targeted at the highest priority risk factors that threaten global societal stability. The resulting observations will, for the first time, provide the irrefutable evidence needed for quantitative forecasts of the dominant risk factors stemming from the global use of fossil fuels.While satellites have for years dominated the federal climate programs, for the purpose of developing tested and trusted quantitative forecasts of risk, satellites engender significant disadvantages. In sharp contrast to satellite systems, the new Harvard Climate Observatory provides, for the first time, orders of magnitude improvement in spatial and temporal resolution observations. ESE/EPS 166 will focus explicitly on this new generation of climate observations, forecasting, and resulting advances in public policy.

Indeed large scale, irregular human migration should be considered the new normal, not an unexpected or one-off crisis. It affects the lives of millions, unsettles established governments, creates sharply polarizing policy dilemmas and generates far-reaching administrative, economic and political challenges. This course will focus on distress migration, including refugee flight and other forms of forced displacement, evaluated through the lens of human rights. It will address the multifaceted drivers of the phenomenon, including the enduring legacies of colonization, armed conflict, environmental stress and climate change, global inequality, demographic pressures and increasing globalization. The course will also consider the impact of government responses to the COVID 19 pandemic on forced migrants. Migration actors from UN agencies, NGOs and other civil society organizations, and research experts working in a range of field sites will contribute to the class.The course will address the legal frameworks governing migration, and the ethical and pragmatic considerations that influence policies. It will explore the viability of a range of solutions to current migration challenges, including unequal access to protection, the failure of equitable resettlement and the erosion of host empathy/solidarity. The extent to which pandemic related measures conform to or violate legal and ethical obligations will also be considered. A key goal is to enable students to analyze current migration situations with clarity and rigor concerning the obligations of states and the rights of migrants. Using examples of large-scale contemporary population movements – the Ukrainian war and its human impact, the ongoing Tigrayan emergency, the Rohingya exodus, the Venezuelan context, the Mediterranean migration situation, extensive intra-regional mobility within the African continent, US/Mexico/Central American movements, unaccompanied child migration in many regions – the course will examine migration drivers, policy responses and rights challenges such as exclusion and denial of protection, persistent racism in border control, detention, prolonged confinement within refugee camps and forced repatriation. It will also engage with the multiple risks, including statelessness, trafficking, drowning, sexual violence, that migrants face before, during and after their journeys. The course will cover key current policy developments, at the municipal, national, regional and international level. The course will discuss seasonal migration, child migration, undocumented and irregular status, gender factors in migration and the role of xenophobia in driving policy. Students will be required to make in class presentations, to prepare questions for guest lecturers, and to participate in class discussion, including by considering a range of strategies for increasing access to safe mobility as a key redistributive global good.Undergraduate enrollment is limited to juniors and seniors."

But how are they mediated in mass media? What is the role of photography and photojournalism in the creation of these narratives in connection to migration? Co-taught by New York Times photojournalist Kirsten Luce and Faculty Chair of Ethnicity, Migration, Rights Raquel Vega-Durán, this course examines the role of the mass media — in particular photography and photojournalism — in representing borders and migrations. We will pay close attention to how the media narrates borders, border-crossings, and migrant experiences, and will consider how international mobility is shaped by physical, political, linguistic, and other types of borders. We will spend several weeks focusing on the Mexico-USA border, but we will also zoom out to take a more global perspective on borders, considering particular cases from Africa, South America, Asia, and Europe, as well as zooming in to examine local perspectives within Greater Boston.Students will have the opportunity to meet photojournalists and editors (such as Washington Post reporter Nick Miroff, New York Times reporter Annie Correal, Independent journalist and filmmaker Johnny Harris, freelance photojournalist Gabriel Cardenas, Getty Images and Pulitzer prize- winning photographer John Moore, and editor of The Penguin Anthology of Migration Literature Dohra Ahmad); conduct an interview with an individual who has navigated borders and/or immigration bureaucracy; participate in workshops on ways of documenting different kinds of borders; and curate and contextualize a photography exhibit about world borders."

Here, war ecology broadly concerns environments informed by (though certainly not limited to) imperial warfare. The course not only examines how war shapes and sustains territorialization, but also how the aftereffects of war bear upon human and more-than-human landscapes. We will investigate the overlaps between wartime violence and environmental destruction through discussions of militarized ecocide, resource extraction, refugee displacement, chemical warfare, settler colonialism, and more. Students will learn to develop insights into and critical questions about the entanglements of war and environmental destruction—inevitably alongside their relationships with the making of gender, race, sex, space, nations, and power more broadly.

In this course, we will study a range of secondary, primary historical, and cultural sources to address the following questions, and more: Where is Asian/America; how does it differ across locations, generations, and ethnicities? How are Asian/Americans disrupting borders dividing the margins and the mainstream to generate third spaces of belonging and community?

Colonizers, as the Australian anthropologist Patrick Wolfe put it, come to stay: invasion is a structure not an event. This course interrogates this claim by nvestigating the histories, geographies and theories of settler-colonialism, with a focus on the former British colonies, including the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We explore the relationship between settler-colonialism, predicated on the dispossession of land, and other forms of empire in capitalist modernity. We consider the relationship between the frontier and the formation of settler and Indigenous subjectivities. What are the enduring structures of oppression and what are their effects on the colonizer and colonized alike? Balancing the logic of dispossession with histories of creative resistance, we pay special attention to the long history of transnational solidarities between the fourth world and other global decolonizing movements. For instance, what did Indigenous activists in Australia find in their readings of Frantz Fanon and how did their reading inform the development of an Aboriginal Black Panther Party in the early 1970s? What kind of solidarities, if any, are possible between settlers and Indigenous peoples? How can we complicate this binary? We explore the politics and ideology of state sanctioned, state co-opted and anti-state forms of decolonization. We ask whether attempts at reconciliation are meaningful ways to address sovereignty or are further techniques of disposse sion. What decolonized futures can be imagined and enacted? This interdisciplinary course will read selections from Native American and Indigenous Studies, anthropology, history, law, and political theory and consider questions of racial formation, gender, nationalism, and citizenship."

Darwin provided a compelling theory about how species change due to competition in reproducing populations, yet it remains difficult to understand, particularly when applied to ourselves. To enable critical evaluation and discussion of ethical questions and to illustrate connections between science and Buddhism, about one third of this seminar will cover select details of evolutionary genetics. The focus will be on understanding human genetic variation. Buddhism originated with Siddhartha Gautama's enlightenment around 500 BCE, achieved after six years of intense devotion to the problem of human suffering. He emerged as the Buddha, or the Enlightened One, making the bold statement that suffering within each person results from misunderstanding the nature of one's self and its relationship to the ever-changing world. He outlined a program of analytical introspection, morality, and meditation, aimed at solving this problem. As with evolutionary genetics, critical evaluation and discussion of Buddhist ideas in this seminar will be fostered by learning the details of what the Buddha taught. Points of overlap between evolutionary genetics and Buddhism emerge in the ways they undermine appearances, deconstructing phenomena which at first appear wholly unbreakable. We will bring our knowledge of Buddhism to bear on end-of-life issues, the use of human embryos in research, and the prospects for human genetic engineering."

A child stands between two mirrors and sees herself reflected over and over again, smaller and smaller, trailing off to infinity. Does it go on forever? … Does anything go on forever? Does life go on forever? Does time go on forever? Does the universe go on forever? Is there anything that we can be certain goes on forever? ... It would seem that the counting numbers go on forever, since given any number on can always add one. But is that the extent of forever? Or are there numbers that go beyond that? Are there higher and higher levels of infinity? And, if so, does the totality of all of these levels of infinity itself constitute the highest, most ultimate, level of infinity, the absolutely infinite? In this seminar we will focus on the mathematical infinite. We will start with the so-called paradoxes of the infinite, paradoxes that have led some to the conclusion that the concept of infinity is incoherent. We will see, however, that what these paradoxes ultimately show is that the infinite is just quite different than the finite and that by being very careful we can sharpen the concept of infinity so that these paradoxes are transformed into surprising discoveries. We will follow the historical development, starting with the work of Cantor at the end of the nineteenth century, and proceeding up to the present. The study of the infinite has blossomed into a beautiful branch of mathematics. We will get a glimpse of this subject, and the many levels of infinity, and we will see that the infinite is even more magnificent than one might ever have imagined."

These included medical crimes, which, thus far, are the most thoroughly documented examples of ethical transgressions of health care professionals. They include forced sterilizations, the euthanasia systematic patient murder program, and forced brutal medical experiments on the living and the dead. However, under conditions of oppression by the same political system, some health care professionals chose to retain the healing powers of medicine.Anatomy in Nazi Germany is an example of ethical transgressions in the medical sciences that reveals the complex relationships between scientists and the Nazi regime. Changes of the traditional anatomical body procurement manifested in the use of many bodies of Nazi victims in teaching and scientific investigations. Research gradually moved from routine studies to murder, from the anatomy lab to the Nazi prison system and then to the concentration camps. Ultimately, anatomists were complicit with the government through their role in the complete destruction of the perceived enemies of the Nazi regime.This history of medicine can thus serve as a model for the recognition of patterns and common roots with other histories of discrimination, oppression, and atrocities. Also, there are continuities and legacies from this history that reach into the present and have relevance for today's education and practice in the health professions."

It is no wonder that narratives of illness have been of interest to both physician and non-physician writers. This seminar will examine and interrogate both literary and journalistic dimensions of medical writing. The investigation will be chronological, beginning with classic narratives by Tolstoy, Chekhov, and Kafka, and then moving on to more contemporary authors such as William Carlos Williams, Richard Selzer, Oliver Sacks, Susan Sontag, and Philip Roth. Controversial and contentious subjects are sought in these writings: the imbalance of power between physician and patient; how different religions frame the genesis and outcome of disease; the role of quackery, avarice, and ego in molding doctors' behavior; whether character changes for better or worse when people face their mortality; what is normal and what is abnormal behavior based on culture, neuroscience, and individual versus group norms. The presentation of illness in journalism will be studied in selected readings from the New York Times' and Boston Globe's Science sections, as well as periodicals like the New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, Harper's, and the Atlantic Monthly. The members of the seminar will analyze how the media accurately present the science of medicine or play to pop culture. The seminar will study not only mainstream medical journalists, but so called alternative medical writers such as Andrew Weil and celebrity health voices like Gwyneth Paltrow. Patients with different diseases will be invited to speak to the members of the seminar about their experiences. Students will try their hands at different forms of medical writing, such as an editorial on physician-assisted suicide that would appear in a newspaper and a short story that describes a personal or family experience with illness and the medical system."

The seminars will use mathematical puzzles to introduce the basic features of physical laws. Main aspects discussed include the role of symmetries as well as the power of modern math, including abstract ideas in topology, in unraveling the mysteries of the universe. Examples are drawn from diverse areas of physics including string theory. The issue of why the universe is so big, as well as its potential explanation is also discussed.

Can we trust our memories? How is memory affected by misinformation such as fake news? Do smartphones and the Internet help our memories or hurt them? Are traumatic experiences especially well remembered or are they poorly remembered? What are the best ways to study for exams? This seminar will address these and other questions related to the fallibility of memory by considering evidence from studies of healthy people with normal memories, brain-damaged patients who show dramatic forgetting or striking memory distortions, and neuroimaging studies that reveal brain regions and networks that are linked to memory. The framework for the seminar is provided by the idea that the misdeeds of memory can be classified into seven basic sins. Three of the memory sins refer to different kinds of forgetting (transience, absent-mindedness, and blocking), three refer to different kinds of distortions or false memories (misattribution, suggestibility, and bias) and the final sin refers to intrusive recollections (persistence). We will consider how the memory sins impact everyday life and discuss the possibility that they can be conceptualized as by-products of adaptive features of memory, rather than as flaws in the system or blunders made by Mother Nature during evolution. Relatedly, we will also discuss the interplay between remembering past experiences and imagining future experiences, which provides clues regarding the nature and fallibility of memory.

Twenty six hundred years ago at the dawn of recorded history, Egyptian surgeons operated on patients by the shores of the Nile. What diagnoses were they making? What treatments did they offer? How did they understand human anatomy and physiology? A millennium later, the Hippocratic physicians emerged on the Aegean Island of Cos. These physicians left us carefully stated surgical principles based, at least partly, on observation and measurement. Why did they record their wisdom in the form of aphorisms? At around the same time, Shushruta, in what is now India, appears to have offered surprisingly modern surgical care to his patients. Who was he? In the second century CE Galen of Pergamum bursts on to the scene, intending to restore Hippocratic orthodoxy. Why was surgical thinking for nearly two millennia dominated by this his, often erroneous, teaching? The Islamic Golden Age, an explosion of scientific and medical discovery, is a key to our understanding of all that follows in surgical history. Why is this period overlooked today? How did the exposure of Galen's anatomical imprecision by Vesalius in 1543 and his absurd physiology by Harvey in 1628 begin a Medical Enlightenment? Why did it take until the 19th century for surgeons solve the riddles of anesthesia and antisepsis? What were the roles of surgeons in the Eugenics movement and the Holocaust? Is the advice of the Hippocratic physicians that To understand surgery one must go to war true in the 21st Century?Our study will examine these questions and many more. We will visit the site of the first use of ether anesthesia and explore the human body in the anatomy lab at Harvard Medical School.

We take the nuances of developmental differences for granted because we're so accustomed to experiencing them. Nevertheless, defining normal (versus abnormal) development is a complex and controversial task. Development involves a tricky intermingling of environmental stimuli, cultural and social expectations, rapid and not always intuitive changes in brain development, temperamental differences, genetic inheritance, and mind-boggling brain plasticity. The course will start with a consideration of general themes and then move to a chronologic perspective. First, we approach child development as a dynamic force, one which simultaneously engages multiple domains: social/relational, cognitive, physical, moral. We will then switch to examine stages of development in sequence, using our understanding of neurobiological, physical, cultural, and psychological factors to inform our assessment of how children change over time. Readings will include classic papers on development, textbook chapters that provide overviews of specific developmental stages, recently published research articles on genetic inheritance, selected contemporary children's and young adult literature, personal memoirs, and short stories written about childhood."

We will use multiple perspectives: medical observations and texts that provide practical knowledge (e.g. The New England Journal of Medicine review articles), narrative readings to understand how patients experience the meaning of illness from the inside out (e.g. The Center Cannot Hold), visitors who will discuss their experience with mental illness, and how development-related mental illness is portrayed in the press (e.g. The New Yorker articles). We will start with the mental life of babies and how scientists interpret infants' nonverbal ways of finding safety and security. This begins the journey of our understanding fundamental needs for tenderness, holding, and making meaning. Understanding how conditions such as autism, depression, and schizophrenia are described in clinical research and literature will help us to appreciate the biological vulnerabilities and relational patterns that may disrupt the human connection. We will examine the resourcefulness required for both fragility and resiliency.

We will consider the revolutionary developments of quantum mechanics and general relativity; and will investigate the key concepts which separated these developments from the physical theories which previously existed. We will then delve into modern particle physics and cosmology and how theory and experiment culminated in the Standard Model of particle physics which physicists use today as well as the current cosmological model based on the Big Bang theory and inflation. We will also move beyond the standard theories into more speculative arenas, including supersymmetry, string theory, and theories of extra dimensions of space, as well as ideas about the nature of dark matter and black holes.

How can death be a misfortune if you are no longer around to experience that misfortune? Is it possible to survive after death? What does it mean for you to survive after your death? Is there such a thing as an immaterial soul distinct from your body? Is immortality something you should want in the first place?

Much that they learned in school seems superficial, incomplete, oversimplified, or incorrect. Is it possible to know the way the world is? Can I know that I am not a brain in a vat being manipulated into thinking that I am an embodied human being? Can I know that the Louisiana Purchase occurred in 1803, that electrons have negative charge, that Hamlet is a masterpiece, that the sun will rise tomorrow?

We will analyze the speeches as pieces of legal rhetoric and for the insight they offer into ancient approaches to crime and punishment, the regulation of sexuality, the trial jury, and court procedure. Taught by a law professor, the focus will be on comparing ancient and modern approaches to problems faced by all legal systems. We will use the ancient material as a jumping off point to debate modern legal topics such as the role of victims in the criminal process, jury nullification, the proper exercise of discretion in prosecution and sentencing, the provocation doctrine in modern homicide law, transitional justice institutions (human rights prosecutions, amnesties, truth commissions); theories of punishment, the use of collective sanctions in international law, free speech and the protection of dissent in a democratic society, and direct vs. representative models of democracy.

The seminar is designed to encourage students to critically evaluate the human rights movement while offering an introduction to some of the essential tools and strategies used by human rights advocates, including advocacy, litigation, documentation, and report writing. Students will consider tough questions, such as: How can human rights be harnessed to successfully influence and change behavior? What does responsible, effective human rights advocacy look like? How do we engage without perpetuating power differentials along geopolitical, class, race, gender, and other lines? How do we find ways to work in collaboration with directly affected communities? What does it mean to be a human rights advocate working on abuses affecting individuals and communities remote from yourself? How do you balance broader advocacy goals with the needs of individual survivors or clients? How do you determine when to intervene and devote limited resources to a given issue?

The intellectual foundations of this are the first and second theorems of welfare economics. The purpose of the seminar is to introduce the students to these results but also to their limitations. Most economists think that market outcomes will fail to be efficient in the presence of large-scale externalities/public goods, and government intervention is then justified. Examples are national defense, clean air, and the mother/father of them all: global warming resulting from carbon emissions. Another very topical issue is inequality. There is no particular reason to think that a market economy will yield an equitable distribution of income, and given this what is the appropriate government response?

Genes provide the basic blueprint for brain architecture, but experiences shape the activity of the genome and thus determine how the circuitry is wired. Significant adversity can derail developmental processes and distort brain maturation, leading to limited economic and social mobility. Exposure to significant adversity early in life, particularly during critical periods of brain development, may increase risk for a host of chronic physical health problems, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and addictive behavior; it can also lead to a variety of mental health problems, including depression and anxiety and characterological problems. Science clearly indicates that the longer we wait to intervene on behalf of such children, the more difficult it becomes to achieve healthy outcomes. This constraint is particularly true for children who sustain the wear and tear of early exposure to so‐called toxic stress. In this seminar we will critically examine the range of adverse early experiences that impact children growing up in both low and high resource countries. Key themes include a) the nature of the adversity children are exposed to, b) the timing of the adversity c) the chronicity of the adversity, and d) individual differences (including genetic and environmental factors that may confer protection on children exposed to early adversity). We will pay particular attention to the short‐ and long‐term outcomes on physical, neurological and psychological health."

In the study of Korean history, this question is particularly sharp since the postcolonial division of Korea into North and South has thrust the memory of past events into current political discussions as well as scholarly debates. The seminar will investigate selected events in Korean history to map the interaction between historical writing and politics: the origins of Korea; Korean territory and the Korean people; cultural contacts with China and Japan and indigenization; social and regional marginalization and discrimination; Confucian transformation of Chosŏn Korea and its legacy in contemporary Korean culture; the legacy of pre-World War II Japanese occupation; and the contending history of popular movements and religion. Why have some historians pictured Korea as a Japanese colony, a miniature replica of China, or a local variant of Chinese civilization? Why have other historians emphasized certain periods and aspects of Korean history while ignoring others? How have historians described Korea's relationships to China, Japan, and the rest of the world? Has the perception of Korea as a marginalized people and region influenced how its history has been described? Are there any connections between popular traditions and movements and this historical and scholarly discussion?

Special tests – designed to measure everything from intelligence to vocational aptitudes to personality – have been at the center of that effort. In this course, we will explore the at times controversial story of psychological testing, and its larger implications. We will pay attention to the creativity within psychology in the making of such tests, and examine their potential benefits, as well as the drawbacks and dangers of the misuses of these instruments – particularly as tools of social control. Topics covered will include the use of tests in the eugenics movement, testing of immigrants at Ellis Island, academic and military sorting through cognitive tests, the use of personality tests in psychiatric and forensic settings, and the cross-cultural use of personality tests by anthropologists. Since Harvard psychologists have made significant contributions to the history of psychological testing, we will use materials uniquely available on this campus in the course of our work together."

Artificial intelligence is touted as a tool for learning about a complex system in ways that humans can't and has seen exceptional progress in natural language processing and image identification. In this class we explore the emerging linkages between scientific inquiry and artificial intelligence. The central goal of this class is to question the classical role of the scientist as a creator of theories and consider how scientists may become interpreters of theories developed by AI. We do this by developing an understanding of how AI systems actually work (they're astonishingly simple), explain recent success cases, and then consider how we may (or may not) rebuild science in an AI-first manner. Examples will be drawn from the earth and planetary sciences as well as the life sciences. High school calculus and/or computer programming would be extremely useful."
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,FYSEMR,51E,The Story of the Alternating Sign Matrix Conjecture,207517,2025 Fall,4,,,,,,Instructor Permission Required,"Lauren Williams This seminar is intended to illustrate how research in mathematics actually progresses, using recent examples from the field of algebraic combinatorics. We will learn about the story of the search for and discovery of a proof of a formula conjectured by Mills-Robbins- Rumsey in the early 1980's: the number of n x n alternating sign matrices. Alternating sign matrices are a curious family of mathematical objects, generalizing permutation matrices, which arise from an algorithm for evaluating determinants discovered by Charles Dodgson (better known as Lewis Carroll). They also have an interpretation as two-dimensional arrangements of water molecules, and are known in statistical physics as square ice. Although it was soon widely believed that the Mills-Robbins- Rumsey conjecture was true, the proof was elusive. Researchers working on this problem made connections to invariant theory, partitions, symmetric functions, and the six-vertex model of statistical mechanics. Finally in 1995, all these ingredients were brought together when Zeilberger and subsequently Kuperberg gave two proofs of the conjecture. In this course we will survey the story of the alternating sign matrix conjecture, building up to Kuperberg's proof. If time permits, we will also get a glimpse of very recent activity in the field, for example the Razumov-Stroganov conjecture. First-Year Seminars are available only to first-year students.

This seminar will revisit one such event, the discovery of RNA interference and how modern experimental molecular genetics cracked this problem and started a billion-dollar industry. Rare unexpected discoveries in biology, for example catalytic RNAs, instantly extend and broaden our understanding of the world, while the impact of other discoveries (split genes, hopping genes) are more gradual. However, some discoveries challenge firmly supported ideas. The initial description of RNA interference (RNAi) was seemingly magical—the introduction of a RNA molecule matching the sequence of any gene, results in the effective silencing (turning off) of the gene. Further, the silencing signal(s) were extremely potent and mobile, moving between cells, tissues, and generations. A series of seminal discoveries during an amazing four-year period revealed the previously unimagined process. We will read and talk about how these discoveries were made and how this unexpected new biology launched new therapeutic companies and is informing developing ideas about heritability, adaptation, and evolution."

Consider water: vapor, liquid, solid! The solid phase will generally have a crystalline structure (liquid is amorphous or has no long-range order). It can be an insulator, semiconductor, or metal; it can be magnetic or non-magnetic. In this seminar we shall discuss a number of remarkable phases of matter. Below a certain temperature a metal can become superconducting, flow of electrical current without resistance; helium liquifies and at lower temperature becomes a superfluid, fluid flow without dissipation. As temperature is lowered, magnetic moments on atoms in a solid align and one observes a ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic phase. Not all materials have a solid phase: helium remains a liquid as temperature approaches absolute zero. But, applying pressure causes liquid helium to solidify. We shall discuss not only the materials but the techniques to create high and low temperature, high pressure, and high magnetic fields that affect the phases of matter and how they are studied.

How does one find meaning in life? What if God or the divine is silent, absent, or uncaring?Literature and the arts have proven to be especially fruitful areas for people not only to explore these questions but also to offer ways of finding consolation in the midst of crisis. In this course we will study a wide range of representations of spiritual crisis and consolation from ancient times up to the present, including authors such as Euripides, Boethius, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Annie Dillard, and Shusako Endo. We will consider how personal convictions and religious belief, including indifference and uncertainty, shape characters' responses to crises. In the process we will reflect on the possibilities and the limits of language and artistic expression both to give voice to the depths of spiritual crisis and to imagine the possibilities for consolation."

Lichtman, Logan McCarty This seminar explores some of science's most significant unsolved challenges: Genuinely Hard Problems (GHPs) that have stumped researchers despite their best efforts. To solve these problems, technical execution is not enough—we need true conceptual breakthroughs. Examples include reconciling quantum mechanics with gravity or finding the biological mechanisms that cause mental illness.A key part of the seminar is identifying a GHP that deeply interests you. Each week will feature Harvard faculty whose research is related to these GHPs. Maybe it's the origin of life, dark matter and the structure of the universe, or cracking the code of human aging. They will make a pitch to serve as your academic mentor, and together, you'll plan an undergraduate curriculum focused on building the skills and knowledge you'd need to tackle your chosen GHP. You'll also study historical cases where seemingly impossible problems were solved, often by young researchers with fresh perspectives. By the end of the seminar, you'll have a clearer picture of the scientific landscape and where you might fit into it. We hope that some of you will embark on a tailored academic journey here at Harvard, aimed at equipping you to address some of science's most profound mysteries. No prior scientific expertise is required—just deep curiosity, openness to failure, and willingness to grapple with big ideas. First-Year Seminars are available only to first-year students.

From ancient Chinese emissaries and intrepid Buddhist pilgrims to swashbuckling Swedes and adventurous Americans, the Silk Road has produced countless storytellers with enchanting accounts of East meets West. But what do we really know about who and what moved along the Silk Road, and how do we know it? Did the Silk Road ever in fact exist? This seminar invites you to embark on your own Silk Road journey, exploring the material and historical reality behind the fabled Eurasian trade routes, the invention of the idea of the Silk Road, and the ways in which different Silk Road stories serve today as the basis for artistic, political, and economic communities. In the process, we will consider the timeless allure of silk, the natural history of Bombyx mori, study attitudes toward cultural patrimony, and get hands-on experience in the Harvard museum collections, where the University's own history and that of the Silk Road intersect. The seminar aims to introduce you to the history of what we know as the Silk Road and to problematize that history in various ways; to expose you to the idea that globalization is a process with no beginning and no end; to challenge you to think about the role of culture in society and politics yesterday and today; and to persuade you that travel is the only way out of the prison of our own limited consciousness."

Why are they so distinctly human in the natural world? Is language a creation of our intelligence, i.e. we speak, because we are smart, or the other way around? Birds produce sophisticated songs. Do bird songs mean anything? They do, in some way. They serve, for example, as predator warnings or mating calls. Humans too, like birds, can produce music. But for effective day to day communication (or, say, to develop a scientific theory, etc.), we need languages with words and sentences, i.e. the kind of languages which is unique to our species. Do all languages, in spite of looking so diverse, share a common structure? For example, in English words fall into categories: cat is a noun, meow is a verb. Do all languages have nouns and verbs? A fairly recent turning point in addressing these fundamental questions has been to view language as a computational device. This is enabling us to build effective models of how languages are structured so as to empower us with the ability to create meaning; which, in turn, is shedding light, more and more, on who we are. The seminar will explore how natural languages come to create meaning and invite participants to develop their own linguistic analyses through modern logical and computational tools.

Shostakovich's fifteen symphonies span his entire creative life; starting with his First Symphony, which made the 19-year old composer famous overnight, and ending with his Fifteenth, completed four years before his death. As a public genre, the symphony was the perfect vehicle for Shostakovich to react to his tumultuous times and explore the human psyche. The ups and downs of Soviet politics and culture indelibly shaped Shostakovich's career: the innovative fervor after the Russian Revolution, Stalinism (Socialist Realism and the Terror), the Second World War, the post-Stalin Thaw after 1956, all the way to the height of the Cold War. Shostakovich was at times encouraged and supported by the Soviet regime, and at other times, reprimanded and punished severely. But Soviet audiences always treasured his work because they heard in it deeply felt emotions that could not be publicly acknowledged. Today's audiences react just as strongly, for different reasons. In the seminar, we will listen closely to all fifteen of Shostakovich's symphonies, learning about their musical features and the political contexts in which they were born and received. We will focus on three main themes: 1) composing in a totalitarian state, 2) how music can be said to narrate, and 3) the orchestra as sound world. We will work from scores and selected recordings, and will attend a live performance of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. First-Year Seminars are available only to first-year students.

What does religion do for human beings? What does an evolutionary and biologically informed understanding of the mind and brain lead us to think about where religion fits in human life? Harvard's first psychologist, William James, engaged these questions in the late nineteenth century, bringing the cutting edge of empirical psychology to the philosophy of religion. Today these same questions animate the field of neuroscience, where researchers are showing how affectivity, emotions, and our evolutionary past come together to form the self philosophers have long thought to be primarily rational. This seminar brings together the thought of James, writing at the turn of the twentieth century, with the work of contemporary neuroscientist Antonio Damasio to ask what kinds of beings we are, how our minds function, and what religion contributes to human individual and societal experience? The seminar takes up the philosophy of belief, affect, and emotion, and touches on the biology of the brain and homeostasis. We conclude by assessing contemporary views of religion from evolutionary psychology (Boyer, Atran) and cultural anthropology (Geertz, Luhrmann, Asad) in light of James's and Damasio's models of the human mind."

Narrative voice is a lively dialogue between the author and the reader as they engage in the experience of determining the value and veracity of the narrative: whose story is it anyway? The writer creates the imaginative universe of character, plot, emotions and ideas—she seems to be holding all the cards; but it is the reader who rolls the dice as she draws on her human experience and moral values to question the principles and priorities of the storyteller. The game of narrative becomes deadly serious when storytelling confronts issues of colonialism, slavery, racial profiling and gender discrimination. Is the right to narrative restricted to those who have suffered the injustices of exclusion? What is my responsibility as a storyteller—or a reader—if I am a witness to violence, or an advocate against injustice, but my life-story is one of privilege, protection and security? What is the role of the politics of identity or cultural appropriation in determining whose story is it anyway? Throughout the seminar students will be encouraged to draw on their own histories, memories and literary experiences as the enter into the world of the prescribed readings. For the final assessment I hope students will choose critical and creative ways of telling their own stories, or the stories of others who have captured their imaginations. Seminar participants will be required to come to each class with two questions that pose issues or problems based on the texts that are important for them, and may prove to be significant for their colleagues. I will invite members of the group to pose their questions and start a discussion."

The very name, 'avant-garde' (from French, literally 'advance guard') carries military connotations that suggest a total, violent break with the past. Our seminar will look at another side of this radical change, asking whether the avant-garde might also be playful, rather than violent, making possible an interplay between invention and convention? And what is the afterlife of the avant-garde? How did its legacy inform aesthetic innovation in a later period? We will try to answer these questions by studying a small set of textual and visual artifacts from the long twentieth century, cutting across different continents and political formations. We will begin with conceptual experiments of the Dada and Suprematist groups and Italian and Russian Futurism and their convoluted relationship with Fascist and Communist ideologies. We contrast these historical examples with later work, like that of Andy Warhol, Nam June Paik, and Joseph Beuys. We will consider cinematic experiments of Dziga Vertov and Jean- Luc Godard, ending with David Lynch's radical displacement of the reigning ideology of Hollywood in his 2001 masterpiece Mulholland Drive. This nearly century-long framework will allow us to investigate a range of artistic, social, and political mobilizations of the term 'avant-garde'. We will be doing short readings and working through them together in class, helping students learn how to read theoretical texts as well as read novellas and watch films in the light of theory. to the ICA, Boston.

Our guides will be contemporary artists and thinkers who are encouraging new relationships between human and vegetal life, or recalling very old ones. Suddenly, we have plant protagonists, gardens in galleries, and botany-based forms of philosophy, architecture, music and more. Following the lead of these culture-makers and their work, we will draw on the new science of plant communication and learning in this class; uncover plant-based histories and renew ancient understandings of human-plant relations. But plants themselves will also be primary sources, as each student follows a sequence of exercises to deepen understanding of a plant interviewee—one they'll grow at home from an unidentified seed. At the same time, we will ask critical questions: with climate crisis upon us, in a time of social inequity, poisonous politics, and mass dislocations, why this attraction to plants? Is the vegetal turn a diversion from tough human problems? Or is there reason to think a cultural change could, even now, change the fate of nature? No prior art or botanical knowledge is expected.

These artistic practices lend his figures and his canvases an unheard-of presence, bringing them to life for us. His art paved the path for countless artists central to Western and contemporary art, including Rubens, Vouet, Ribera, de la Tour, Bernini, Velázquez, Rembrandt, Vermeer, Goya, David, Turner, Delacroix, Courbet, Manet, Cézanne, Renoir, Gauguin, Sargent, Picasso, Hopper, Schiele, Dali, Scorsese, Jarman, Placido, Sherman, Fischnaller, Doig, Dalla Venezia, Collishaw, and O'Connor.In this seminar, besides working on how to analyze paintings, we will examine the majority of Caravaggio's oeuvre, from the early secular paintings through his revolution in religious painting, which reached its height in Rome between 1598 and 1606 and then took on other characteristics as he moved to Naples, then Malta, then Siracusa, then Messina, then back to Naples, before he died in 1610 at the age of 39. We will be primarily concerned with 1) the nature and art of his naturalism, 2) how he disturbs that naturalism even as he creates it, 3) how his naturalism itself becomes disturbing, and 4) how this disturbance, particularly in the religious paintings, takes on the quality of double entendre, as the eroticism that characterizes his work from early on develops into sometimes shockingly sexualized treatments of religious scenes and narratives, so that, rather than occupying a middle ground between the sacred and the profane, as a seventeenth-century bishop said of his work, Caravaggio can be seen to have inflected the sacred with the profane, producing a frisson that — along with his brilliant, and dark, naturalism — makes him ever of current interest."

Gender justice, as is true of justice more broadly, is often discussed in the abstract, or as a matter of law, political history, protest movements, enfranchisement, and similar phenomena. Yet at its core, justice involves individuals and their experiences - both their suffering and their triumphs - experiences most directly accessed through stories. In this seminar we'll explore a range of stories and different forms of storytelling on gender justice, from novels and films to memoirs/personal histories, histories, and creative nonfiction. Some narratives with which we will engage are Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, Ito Shiori's Black Box: The Memoir that Sparked Japan's #MeToo Movement, Audre Lorde's The Cancer Journals, Cho Nam-joo's Kim Jiyoung, and Cherrie Moraga and Gloria Anzaldua's This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color.

Information – or perhaps misinformation – bombards us at all times, but assessing the reliability and trustworthiness of our sources is notoriously difficult. Sometimes it seems as though different groups of people inhabit different worlds, with precious little common ground on precisely the matters that they each take to be most important. These phenomena have not escaped the notice of contemporary epistemologists; that is, philosophers who are interested in investigating the nature of knowledge, rationality, and justification. In this seminar we will read recent work on what one might call applied epistemology, touching on a broad range of contemporary social issues that are, at their core, epistemological issues. We begin by examining two questions in traditional epistemology that have recently skyrocketed to cultural prominence: the question of how to respond to disagreement with people who seem just as smart and well-informed as you are, and the question of whether pointing out factors that influence your beliefs but seem to have nothing to do with their truth should have a debunking effect. We will then use these concepts to explore a smorgasbord of hot topics in contemporary applied epistemology; topics covered include fake news, echo chambers, distrusting scientists, motivated reasoning, epistemic benefits that arise from marginalization, and responsibility for one's own and others' ignorance. Throughout, we place particular focus on distinguishing cases in which people believe badly from cases in which responsible believers are unwittingly and unfortunately led astray. visit from Michael Rain, (https://www.michaelra.in/) who studies the flow of (mis)information through informal communication channels, such as WhatsApp, used by immigrant groups.

Each section of the book will be complemented by readings that put the issue in a larger context. These texts include a few of the foundational philosophical works for contemporary debates around identity, contemporary philosophical analyses of the underlying issues, and critiques of the discussion of identity as understood by philosophers like Appiah.

But Chekhov has long since transcended this original context. He is celebrated as one of the greatest short story writers of all time, and his plays are performed more frequently around the world than those of any other playwright, excepting Shakespeare. Once you've spent time with Chekhov, he will stay with you forever.Chekhov's work can be funny or very sad, and sometimes it is both at the same time. Much of Chekhov's meaning lies in the details, and in what is not said as much as what is made explicit. This seminar seeks to sharpen your skills as a discerning reader and interpreter. We will also go beyond the page to explore Chekhov's work as produced on stage and screen, beginning with his partnership with Konstantin Stanislavsky, the director of the Moscow Art Theater, where Chekhov's plays were first enthusiastically received. Since then, Chekhov's plays have been produced across a diverse range of approaches, which we'll sample. More broadly, we will consider Chekhov's life and times and explore his on- going reception inside Russia and around the world."

If yes, what or who is God? Where does the Universe come from? Are we alone in the Universe? What is a good life? Are there universal human rights? Can wars be just? What makes a good leader? This seminar will use texts and art from the Catholic intellectual tradition to explore how Catholic thought can be applied to contemporary challenges, as well as areas where there may be tension between such thought and contemporary ideas. While the seminar addresses the thought from one particular religion, it does not assume any prior knowledge of Catholicism, much less religious belief. Rather, this seminar is for the curious, who are interested in engaging with the Catholic intellectual tradition, and exploring how its ideas interact with contemporary life. These ideas will be presented through a combination of original texts, more recent essays, art, music, architecture, and movies. Due to the wide range of texts and subjects covered, this course relies on several guest lecturers that have expert knowledge in particular aspects of Catholic thought."

Including unauthorized continuations and transformations of popular media texts, fanfiction is written primarily by young women and non-binary fans, and published online. We will dive into fanfiction's past and present, learning about the history of copyright, early print zine fandom, and fanfiction in the digital age. Through studying fanfiction, students will explore a variety of methods for studying culture, including literary analysis (how do fanfiction writers achieve certain effects? Does fanfiction have its own style?), platform analysis (how does Wattpad work differently from the Archive of Our Own, and how do these differences shape engagement and community?), and historical analysis (what did early fanzines look like? What can they tell us about the communities who produced them?). We will also explore fanfiction as a genre of creative response: in what ways can a story criticize, develop, or explain a piece of media that an essay cannot? Students will have the opportunity to choose their own final assignment, which can include doing research into fanfiction history, analyzing fanfiction, or writing a piece of fanfiction. Fandoms discussed may include: Sherlock, Harry Potter, The Untamed, Supernatural, Star Wars, Star Trek, Marvel, DC, Pride and Prejudice, The Lord of the Rings, Sherlock Holmes, ACOTAR. While there is no prerequired reading, familiarity with one or more of these popular media franchises is recommended. fanfiction stories, but those are not yet specified on the syllabus. Because of the unique nature of fanfiction, it is desirable that students all be familiar with the original sources of the stories, but these are often too extensive to require them as prior reading for the seminar. Therefore, the professor will select and assign fanfiction stories in consultation with students that are appropriate for the week's discussion, after polling the students on their interest and prior exposure to different popular culture texts.

This seminar will examine how the biology of prosocial behaviors shows how kindness and optimism improve overall well-being in profound and demonstrable ways. We will delve into a revolutionary approach to health, longevity, and quality of life and explain the scientific evidence that supports this work. The class will investigate five fundamental values of prosocial behaviors — kindness, optimism, forgiveness, gratitude, and happiness — and collectively engage in six essential strategies for cultivating these values—relationships, nutrition, physical activity, meditation, music, and nature. Along the way we will read the scientific data that reveals the impact such behavior has on biology, particularly on telomeres, the parts of DNA that serve as biomarkers of aging. While DNA is mostly immutable, telomeres are influenced by our choices.

In organizations, these highly uncertain, high-stakes decisions are delegated upward, to men and women in leadership positions. They have to make final decisions on these problems, despite the gray, and these decisions test their competence and their humanity. This seminar offers a variety of important perspectives on gray-area problems and on ways to resolve them, responsibly and effectively. The seminar begins by examining gray area problems in various professions and lines of work. Subsequent sessions focus on three different ways of resolving gray area problems – in terms of accountability, character, and action. A typical session of the seminar will draw upon classic works of fiction, basic ideas in moral philosophy, and contemporary situations. These situations are typically described in short case studies involving men and women early in their careers, and they give students in the seminar the opportunity to grapple with these problems in personal terms – by discussing what they would do in these situations.

It has radically altered modes of interpersonal engagement, democratized access to tools of mass communication, and changed the role of gatekeepers that traditionally controlled access to music, video, and other media. Given the breadth of its impact, it is not surprising that the Internet has pushed the bounds of legal doctrines that govern speech, privacy, and the creation and exploitation of content. Mass-scale online distribution of copyrighted works tests the limits of legal doctrines developed in an era of physical copies. Age-old tensions between privacy and the right to free expression have been exacerbated in cases where one's right to speak bumps up against the desire of another to keep information private. And, the ability to share—and, thus, to consume—extraordinary amounts of personal data has impacted government (which collects and uses data for purposes of law enforcement) and private companies (which collect and use data for purposes of advertising and monetization). This seminar will provide an overview of legal doctrines that govern the online conduct of individuals and institutional actors. It will address the rights and responsibilities of the intermediaries that mediate many of our online activities – social networks, cloud-based storage services, email providers, and the like. Students will consider old and new legal frameworks and the ways in which the law informs strategic decisions for those that operate online. The seminar will address some of the most important and complex policy debates of our day—regarding the proper scope of intellectual property protection; the balance between a robust environment for online free expression and a desire to protect against harmful speech; and the ways in which the law addresses privacy vis-à-vis both government and private actors. Readings and in-class conversations will cover legal cases and case studies, offering students a high-level view of the technical, legal, and business landscape and allowing them to delve deeply into particularly difficult sets of problems concerning the regulation of online conduct."

And will the jobs be worth having? People have worried about losing their jobs to technology at least since the Luddites 200 years ago. In the aggregate, they have been wrong. The automobile put lots of stable boys and saddle makers out of work, but it created vastly more jobs making cars, and fueling them and repairing them, and it opened the way for whole new industries like roadside motels and restaurants. With robots increasingly performing the tasks once done by blue-collar labor, however, and computers and artificial intelligence now eliminating the need for many workers once thought to be immune because of their cognitive skills, today's technological threat seems different. It is no longer just the unskilled and undereducated whose jobs are at risk. Moreover, the challenge may be especially acute in America, where wages are far higher than in many other countries and an ever greater share of what we consume and invest not only can be provided from overseas but often is. Does the next generation of Americans, then, face a genuine threat from advancing workplace technology? If so, what are the dangers – not just economic, but social, political, even moral – to the country as a whole? Most important, what can we do about it?"

We can get a very good sense of a world without airplanes by looking at the age of sail, the roughly three centuries (1550-1850) when European colonization—and resistance to it—globalized the planet within the social and technological constraints of sailing ships, with legacies that endure. Before the rise of steam power in the nineteenth century, water and wind provided the fastest means of long-distance travel or communication.

Stuck in a frustrating period of waithood or waiting for adulthood, urban youths in Africa are increasingly devising enterprising ways to improvise their livelihoods and assert their right to the city. One creative way in which youths are responding to everyday uncertainty and frustrations is through the power of pop culture, which includes creating new artistic, musical, performance, and fashion forms that extend across and beyond African cities. Consider, for example, the cross-cultural power and global appeal of Afrobeats. Notable American musicians, from Beyoncé to Pharrell Williams and Chris Brown, are fast integrating African pop music into their sounds as part of the upward trend of the Afro-Cool in the United States. This, of course, raises important questions about the boundaries between what is cultural appreciation and what is cultural appropriation. In this seminar, we ask: In the face of the contradictions of modern city life in Africa, in which people's opportunities and expectations are simultaneously broadened and constrained, how do young people fashion new ways of being and interacting with society? In what ways can crisis become opportunity? To address these questions, we will watch films, listen critically to music, analyze written texts, take virtual tours, and visualize fashion and popular art forms that shed new light on the hustle economy in urban Africa, its relationship with pop culture in American cities, and the innovative ways in which young people are making their voices heard in the city.

Through case studies involving natural gas in Myanmar, gold mining in Papua New Guinea, and chocolate in West Africa, we will discuss both the harms communities experience and how communities can have a seat at the table to demand their rights and take on oppressive systems. We will also look at how North America is implicated in these cases and consider the power dynamics between communities, advocates, businesses, and states that span borders and different cultures.

The transition from adolescence to adulthood is often fraught with anxieties about realizing one's dreams, getting into college, succeeding in the job market, and finding a life partner. Have the definitions and markers of adulthood changed across generations? Should these conceptualizations change or adapt to the times? Are young people today trapped in an extended adolescence? Some experts and the popular press contend that young people today are coddled and more resistant to growing up than were those who came of age a generation or more ago. Conversely, other experts and many young adults today find that growing up is harder—harder to launch a career, burdened by student loan debt, harder to find a compatible life partner—in general, harder to achieve the life their parents have. Amid these debates, it is unclear what is meant by adulthood and whether it can or should be defined by the same markers as have been used in the past. Today's young adults are charting their own path…or are they? In this seminar, students will define and redefine adulthood based in multiple contexts, considering catalysts and impediments on the pathway to adulthood. Using a historical lens, we will examine and understand the contexts that elicit longer and shorter pathways to adulthood, including the role of the economic context, educational and occupational opportunities, gender, and the need to co-construct adulthood with others. Whereas societal factors are often considered contextual, this seminar focuses on societies as active agents in shaping adolescents' beliefs about adulthood and struggling with and sometimes against adolescents as they navigate their place as adults. This seminar takes a global lens and focuses on the ways in which the transition to adulthood is a dynamic and co-constructed concept and will aid students in developing an integrative understanding on societal needs and pressures and young adults' tools in navigating the path to adulthood."

Democracies are designed with certain mechanisms to generate political accountability. Re-elections are meant to give voters a tool to reward or punish incumbents for their behavior in office, government oversight agencies like auditing institutions are intended to police politicians from within, and so on. Despite this range of methods for keeping politicians accountable, why is there still so much corruption and impunity within government? Why don't politicians provide the policies and public services people seem to want? What are the barriers citizens and civil society face in engaging in politics? What can we learn from citizen efforts to reign in politicians even within authoritarian regimes? Most importantly, what policies could we implement to reduce impunity and strengthen accountability?"

How has control over oil—the single most important commodity in the world—shaped the nature of power, politics, and environmental and social life in the twentieth century? How have different disciplines contributed to and at times undermined a critical understanding of oil politics? This interactive seminar will address these and other questions by examining the political, social, material and cultural history of oil. Given the centrality of oil to modern life, control over this prized resource has resulted in a complex and often violent history. We will thus look at the ways in which the political economy of oil has shaped the rise and fall of empires, the fate of nation-states, the making of the economy, the nature of class, gender, and racial discrimination, and the production of historical knowledge and the built urban environment. By moving between primary source documents and films, novels, multi-disciplinary scholarly analyses, in-class discussions, and written assignments, students will learn to be principal investigators and thereby sharpen their own critical interpretive abilities.

Susanna Rinard Emotions are central to our lives as human beings. Strong emotions (both our own, and other people's) are often involved in both the best and the worst times of our lives. In this seminar we will ask questions like the following: Where do emotions come from? How do they arise, and to what extent is it possible for us to exercise agency over the existence and expression of our emotions? Are emotion categories like anger universal, or culturally relative? Is there something that all instances of anger (for example) have in common, or does anger encompass a diverse range of states and experiences? Is there a single basis for anger in the brain? Is it possible that we can create an emotion in ourselves by ascribing that emotion to ourselves?For help answering these and other related questions, we will turn to three sources, considered in rotation, to help us construct a dialogue between these authors as they develop their ideas. Brene Brown, in Atlas of the Heart, surveys the incredible complexity of human emotion and offers advice on managing these emotions. Lisa Feldman Barrett, in How Emotions Are Made, describes surprising results from neuroscience that contradict folk common sense about the nature of emotions and how they come about. Jean Briggs, in Never in Anger, describes a way of life in which the categorization and expression of emotion is very different from certain other cultures.

From depicting rulers as gods to using comedy to criticize leaders, we will delve into the visually striking ways societies have grappled with their political systems through art.We will meet at the Harvard Art Museums' Art Study Center, where we will take advantage of the Museums' vast collections. Each week, we will explore different artworks and analyze them in their national and political contexts. We will also read sociological literature that will help us make sense of these works and dive into the Harvard Art Museums' archives to gain a deeper understanding of their social and political contexts. We will see how the engagement between art and politics brings to light core aspects of national identity, belonging, memory, and resistance. The seminar will include visits to the Harvard Memorial Church and the Ethelbert Cooper Gallery of African & African American Art, which will help us gain a broader understanding of the cultural and political context of art.Through this seminar, students will discover the power of art in civic dynamics and gain a new perspective on the complex relationship between art, society, and politics.

It is commonly thought that wars end after a decisive military battle produces a conclusive victory – one side surrenders and the other side emerges victorious. In fact, recent history suggests things are typically much more complicated: negotiations between the disputants commonly play a critical role in ending armed conflict. One only must consider Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq.This seminar will initially introduce students to some core ideas relating to negotiation and bargaining theory. Through readings, we will then explore how several wars in fact evolved. We will ask why did the war begin, and did the disputants first attempt to avoid armed conflict through negotiations? To what extent, if any, did negotiations between the combatants end the fighting? We will see that while the expectations and aims of the combatants are typically deeply opposed at the beginning of a war, over time they often converge toward an agreement to stop fighting. In such cases, what produces this convergence? To what extent do factors far removed from the battlefield - economic, political, and social – contribute to the success of negotiations?In addition to readings, students will engage in a few negotiations related exercises and simulations in class."

We will explore these important changes in light of competing explanations of crime and punishment. Inequalities by neighborhood, race, class, and birth cohort will be emphasized, and strategies to promote safety and reform the criminal justice system will be debated.The seminar will emphasize group discussion and learning experiences in the greater Boston area. In one session, the Chief of the Harvard University Police will visit the class and engage with students in discussions about crime and community, including safety at Harvard and its relationship to Cambridge and Boston. In another session, students will report on in-person or virtual visits to neighborhoods in the local area that are of significance for issues we are studying.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences,FYSEMR,73V,"Antisemitism, Then and Now",226360,2025 Fall,4,,,,,,Instructor Permission Required,"Derek Penslar Why do people hate each other? Why are some groups of people more likely to be hated than others? This seminar seeks to answer these questions through the study of the hatred of Jews, commonly known as antisemitism. Jews have lived throughout the world over thousands of years, and they have been hated for diverse and at times contradictory reasons – they are said to be too different or trying too hard to fit it; religious extremists or extremist secularists; rich capitalists or revolutionary socialists; having no nation or roots, or fanatically attached to the state of Israel. Are there aspects of antisemitism, or other forms of group hatred, that transcend these differences and have common bonds? Is antisemitism an illness, or a symptom of a variety of maladies? In this seminar, we will address these questions. We will do so by tracing Jew-hatred from antiquity to the present, in both Christian and Islamic lands. Our approach will be anchored in history, but we will draw upon insights from the humanities, such as theology and philosophy, and the social sciences, such as sociology and psychology. We will discuss religious and legal texts, political writings, polemics, and literature. We will also examine depictions of Jews in art and film. Through this course, we will learn how social pathologies like antisemitism grow out of basic human psychological needs, and how we can best address those needs without resorting to hatred of others.

Educated citizens should have opportunities to study the issue in detail and to decide what they think. This seminar is designed to help first-year students discuss, in an academic setting, the difficult, important, and controversial questions raised by abortion. These include questions of ethics, policy, and law; of human personhood and futures of value; of autonomy and equality; of politics and history; and of unenumerated rights and judicial power.Many of these questions are both highly abstract and deeply personal. While they're the subject of intense and heartfelt commitment on both sides, this seminar is offered in the belief that they're also a proper subject for intellectual inquiry. Within each unit, the assigned readings are roughly balanced as to viewpoint; they take deeply conflicting positions, and each student will certainly disagree with some of them.

Both ethnographic and theoretical readings serve as the material for class discussion and the foundation for ethnographic fieldwork.At once a crash course in ethnographic theory and ethics, and a practicum in qualitative methods, FM97 weds scholarly inquiry and academic study to practical experience in cultural documentation and personal involvement with local tradition bearers and folk communities. Guided by an interdisciplinary collection of texts, students will have the opportunity to study folklore from the ground up, not only through an academic lens, but through personal relationships, cultural participation, and inquisitive explorations of local communities. Throughout the semester you will be invited to develop skills in qualitative research, cultural documentation, proposal design, interviewing, and the arts of interpretation as you try your hand at fieldwork and ethnography. By examining folkways, expressive culture, traditions, and performances, and interrogating their import in the daily lives of individual and groups, we will aim to bridge the divide between grand theories and everyday practices, between intellectual debates and lived experiences, between the academic institution and the vernacular world. Ultimately, this course aims to bring the folks themselves into the center of the academic study, discussion, and debate.

Designated a federally recognized region as recently as 1965, Appalachia has long been romanticized as America's authentic other. We will explore the many genres that make up Appalachian folklife as well as consider folklore's role in shaping portrayals of Appalachia. We'll also think about the ways that insider-outsider relations impact representations of the region. Discussions will explore issues such as cultural staging in Dolly Parton's Dollyworld, the commodification of Mothman, and the use of folklore as a form of back talk in response to outsider portrayals of the region as backward, homogenous, and unchanging.

Nevertheless, Jewish magic and folklore exhibit remarkable continuities over time, with various ideas and motifs spanning Jewish history from its ancient beginnings to the present.(2) Jewish magical and folkloric traditions sometimes stand at odds with monotheism, yet they draw so heavily on other aspects of Jewish religiosity (e.g., prayer, Torah study, mysticism, etc.) that it can be difficult to define magic and folklore in Jewish contexts.Specific topics to be covered in this course include demonic possession narratives from ancient Israel; nautical tall tales told by the rabbis of Sasanian Iraq; accounts of werewolves, witches, and vampires in Jewish writings from medieval Germany; Ladino ballads; Yiddish fairytales; and many others. This course is designed both for newcomers to the study of Judaism and for students with a background in Jewish studies who are interested in learning more about magic and folklore.

It will also explore the premise that while the contents of otherworldly abduction/intrusion narratives often show remarkable similarities between one cultural context and another, storytellers from different times and places have deployed these traditions in substantially different ways. We will investigate possible reasons both for these similarities and for these differences, drawing especially from relevant scholarship in folklore studies, anthropology, and the comparative study of religion."

Four major themes will be examined. First, the importance of the region in the origin and early development of Western imperialism and capitalism: Why did both Western Europe and America begin their imperial and colonial expansion in this region and to what degree did the region's slave-based economies influence the nature and development of Western capitalism? Second, what were the consequences of imperialism for the demographic and socio-cultural fate of indigenous and African populations? Is genocide a proper designation of the fate of exploited peoples of the region up to the end of the period of slavery? Third, we examine the post-colonial consequences of this history for the socio-political, economic and cultural development of the region. What have been the main paths toward sustainable development in the modern Caribbean? Why in spite of its long history of engagement with Western capitalism, has the region largely faltered in its efforts to develop? We examine the different paths to development through five case studies—neo-colonial dependency in Puerto Rico, communist dependency in Cuba, democratic socialism in Jamaica, Barbados' neo-liberal strategy, and aid-dependency in Haiti. We also study the common problem of migration and transnationalism and the degree to which this process undermines national sovereignty. Fourth, we explore the distinctive features of racial classification and cultural representations in the Caribbean. What do we learn about race as a social construction from the Caribbean experience? How do Caribbean racism and colorism unsettle American notions of race and ethnic identities? Why has globalization not led to cultural homogenization? How do we account for the unusual influence of Caribbean music, especially that of Jamaica, on popular global culture?"

What skills – and more importantly, habits of mind – does this approach require of you as an individual (especially an individual who needs to work in collaboration with other individuals)? What does successful scientific inquiry require of a community – both the community undertaking the inquiry, and the larger society of which it is part? Here you will find the tools to start answering such questions for yourself. You will learn to spot widespread and stubborn errors in reasoning that we humans easily fall prey to, along with techniques for avoiding them. You will uncover some of the fundamental assumptions (about the world we inhabit, and about our access to that world) that science must proceed from, and thereby become more sophisticated about what science can teach us and what it can't. By engaging with these foundational aspects of scientific inquiry, you will come to understand more fully what it means to adopt a critical scientific mindset, and how to do so for yourself.

You will consider systems of governance in Republican Rome, medieval Europe, early modern England and France, Native American nations and the United States. The thinkers and founders you will read thought long and hard what freedom is, how to balance executive and legislative power, and why republics and democracies can be unstable. As a democratic republic, the United States places great faith in the capacity of voters to choose their rulers, who in turn make most of our policies. Is this faith misplaced? What is the role for virtue in a republic, and what is virtue? How does inequality undermine republican stability, and what might be done about it?Screen reader support enabled."
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,GENED,1034,Texts in Transition,212840,2025 Fall,4,Mon/Wed,03:00 PM,04:15 PM,Ann Blair,None,Instructor Permission Required,"Ann Blair, Leah Whittington What makes some texts long-lived while others are ephemeral, today and in the past?Description: We live in a moment of crisis around regimes of preservation and loss. As our communication becomes ever more digital— and, therefore, simultaneously more ephemeral and more durable—the attitudes and tools we have for preserving our culture have come to seem less apt than they may have seemed as recently as a generation ago. This course examines how texts have been transmitted from the past to the present, and how we can plan for their survival into the future. We will examine what makes texts durable by considering especially the media by which they are transmitted, the changing cultural attitudes toward their content, and the institutions by which they are preserved. The European Renaissance will provide a central case study. During this period scholars became aware of the loss of ancient texts and strove to recover and restore them insofar as possible. These interests prompted new developments in scholarly conservation techniques which we still value today (philology, libraries, and museums) but also the creation and transmission of new errors, ranging from well-intentioned but overzealous corrections and improvements to outright forgeries. What can the Renaissance teach us about how to engage productively with these problems, both as the source of our current attitudes toward preservation and loss, and as a case study of another culture dealing with anxiety over preservation and loss? Ultimately, we hope that students will be able to think productively about preservation in the past and in the future, while recognizing that all preservation inherently involves some kind of transformation.

Ten great experiments that have transformed our understanding of nature will guide us, first through immersion in the scholarship and popular beliefs of the time. Next, how did the discoverer prepare? What were the motivations, prior experiences, and training that led to the threshold of a fruitful advance? Then, to the degree possible, we will carry out the exact same investigations, building our own simple equipment from scratch, duplicating the challenges of wresting patterns from noisy and incomplete data. Students will compare their results to both private and published versions of the original research. The course will examine the magnitude of the cognitive shifts experienced and the often uphill battle to acceptance. We will build an understanding of the nature of scientific progress, examining how the mastery of natural phenomena leads to new technologies and how these can contribute to further scientific discovery.Experiments are drawn from the natural sciences, ancient to modern, from Eratosthenes measuring the earth's size to Rosalind Franklin determining the structure of DNA. We will consider how these discoveries continue to impact society, as well as the many ethical questions raised. The course will examine the difficulty of accepting new experimental evidence falsifying accepted scientific paradigms and how this remains an issue that plays out in current society. By unpacking these 10 experiments, students will be able to better prepare for their own future discoveries and contributions."

First, we ask: What is morality? Many people believe that morality descends from above, as divine commands or as abstract, timeless principles akin to mathematical truths. Here we take an empirical approach to morality, viewing it as a natural phenomenon that rises up from below—born of the strategic interactions among lifeforms and societies struggling to exist. Next, we take a scientifically informed look at the foundational questions of moral and political philosophy. Many people believe that the is of scientific knowledge has nothing to do with the fundamental oughts of morality, that science and morality exist in separate realms (and belong in separate courses). Here we challenge this assumption, asking whether our scientific self-knowledge can, and should, change our views about what's right and wrong and how a society should be organized. Finally, we consider the distinctive moral challenges posed by what may be the next stage in Earth's evolutionary history: the rise of artificial intelligence. Many people believe that there is and always will be a fundamental division between human minds and machines. Here we challenge this assumption, going beyond the tropes of science fiction and drawing instead on the latest advances in cognitive neuroscience and neurally inspired artificial intelligence. Our conclusions will have implications for moral challenges of the near and more distant future: Can self-driving cars, military drones, and life-like robots be programmed to behave morally? Will artificial intelligence displace human labor? If so, how can our societies adapt? Could machines displace humans entirely? If so, how can we stay in control? If machines do take over, will they be our conquerors or our children? Across diverse topics, this course explores the implications of a single idea: that the wonder we see around us, and ahead of us, is the product of competition and cooperation at increasing levels of complexity.

We will discuss issues ranging from formal aesthetics to historical representation, from local film industries to transnational audience reception.This course does not assume prior knowledge of East Asian culture or of film studies, but rather seeks to provide students with a basic understanding of modern East Asian cultural history through cinema, and with an essential toolkit for analyzing film and media, including narrative, cinematography, editing and sound. In addition to critical approaches, students are strongly encouraged to creatively respond to course materials by collaborating on their own short films, beginning with the illustration of film terms in the first two weeks and culminating in the Golden Monkey Awards—a class screening of final projects with Oscar-like awards in various categories.As a General Education course, East Asian Cinema will help students develop aesthetic responsiveness and interpretive ability to moving images in an increasingly media-saturated world. While becoming acquainted with some analytical vocabulary and critical approaches to cinema, students will also gain insights into East Asian cultures and histories, aesthetic traditions and ethical values, as well as the politics and economics that went into the films' production and reception. Above all, the course will encourage students to be creative and enterprising with the digital media technologies at our disposal, to engage in collaborative teamwork and experiment with unorthodox ways of looking at the world through amateur filmmaking."

This course aims to teach you how to manage argument and persuasion in your own life – not just with skill, but ethically. Accordingly, we will have two main goals. The first is to develop your skill at recognizing the myriad ways in which language can be used and misused as a tool for persuasion, by teaching you a variety of techniques drawn from formal logic, linguistics, and the discipline of argument-mapping. Master this skill, and anytime someone attempts to persuade you of something, you will be able to understand the structure of their attempt so deeply that you need not fear manipulation, but can decide for yourself whether you wish to sign on to the conclusion they want you to reach. Our second goal is even more important: we hope to show you how you can – and why you should – construct your own arguments with such clarity, honesty, and logical transparency that the people you direct them to will be optimally placed to decide, for themselves, whether and why they ought to agree with you. In this way, you will come to see argument not primarily as a contest to be won or lost, but as something that should be reclaimed for a more noble purpose: building genuine understanding between people, even across profound differences of viewpoint."

We will examine class, nationality, and gender differences within and across groups, and how group boundaries are made stronger or weaker. We will consider how to reduce unproductive polarization, and how you --the new generation of citizens of the world -- can promote a better America even, or especially, when we do not agree on just what better entails.Course readings range from public speeches and interviews to works in political science, sociology, economics, and a bit of genomic science. You will learn how and where the United States has progressed in promoting group equality and fairness, as well as where it has not or has even moved backwards. You will end the course with a deeper understanding of the core American paradox of the persistence of group hierarchy in a country dedicated to democracy, equality, and liberty, and what people such as yourselves can do to resolve that paradox.

In fact, the first description of a heart attack in a human was not until 1912. In the current century, heart diseases will be the leading global cause of death, and the majority of those heart disease deaths will actually occur in the developing world. The epidemic of heart disease has been driven by many social, economic and technological events. Some of these events have been dramatically detrimental to human health, such as the accidental invention of the American cigarette by a slave in North Carolina in the 19th Century—an invention that is projected to kill one billion people between 2000 and 2100. Other events, such as advances in public health and safety, have been beneficial by extending lifespan and preventing early death, but they have also allowed age- related heart diseases to explode. Technological advances have improved our economic productivity but also led to changes in our lifestyles that promote heart diseases. In this course, we will consider the complex relationship of health and society by examining the epidemic in common heart diseases. We will explore how major lifestyle factors such as tobacco, alcohol, exercise and diet affect health, and we will also consider how economics and politics powerfully influence health. We will also discuss the role of government and our obligations to each other, and to future generations. This course has an enrollment cap and is a part of the Gen Ed lottery.

Why is this important? In what ways are humans similar to other species, and how are we different? What are the evolutionary origins of the behavioral and psychological features found across human societies, including parental love, sibling rivalry, pair-bonding, incest aversion, social status, war, norms, altruism, religion, language and cooking? At the same time, how can we account for the immense diversity we observe in behavior and psychology across time and societies? Tackling these questions within a broad evolutionary framework, the course will draw on the latest insights and evidence from evolutionary biology, primatology, anthropological ethnography, neuroscience, genetics, linguistics, economics and psychology. We'll contextualize contemporary behavior by examining studies of non-human primates, especially chimpanzees, and a broad range of human variation based on comparative studies of hunter-gatherers, herders, agriculturalists and—most unusual of all— people from societies that are WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic). Along the way, we'll see how culture has driven much of our genetic evolution and runs deep into our evolutionary history. We'll consider how understanding the evolutionary origins of human behavior, psychology, and culture informs how we approach contemporary issues such as patriarchy, polygamous marriage, sex differences, child abuse, mating preferences, homosexuality, racism, psychological differences among populations and the use of oral contraceptives."

His reference bewildered observers who were unaware of a long tradition of citing Romans 13 in American political controversies, including such formative conflicts as the American Revolution and the sectional crisis over slavery.This course introduces students to a complex history of political invocations of scripture, encouraging them to think about why this practice persists, the interpretive strategies it involves, and the implications of such scriptural appeals for civic culture. Co-taught by faculty with expertise in biblical studies and American history, the course asks students to engage texts thoughtfully, to consider historical contexts thoroughly, and to see why these texts and their use matters in the present.Course materials includes primary sources (e.g., campaign speeches, Congressional debates, Civil Rights slogans) and scholarly literature, such as the wealth of research on the history of biblical justifications for war or the legal theories that guide applications of the First Amendment.Student projects afford class participants the chance to engage in both historical research and textual hermeneutics. The objective of the course is to equip students to recognize the historical legacies that contemporary political conversations carry, to engage critically the modes of textual interpretation that inform political rhetoric, and to write cogently about the complex implications of political appeals to scriptural authority."

Self-help books offer to teach it. Both the arts and the sciences celebrate it. It sits at the heart of some of our oldest myths and is the subject of up-to-the-minute neuroscientific research. Some say it comes in momentary flashes; others call it a way of life. Some identify it as the key to deep fulfillment; others claim that it entails intense suffering. Many agree that it sets us apart as a species—but does it? What is creativity? How have humans made sense of it across centuries and cultures, and what role might it play in our lives today? Exploring creativity takes us into the very question of what makes us human, and the answers we discover can help equip us for the lives we will lead beyond the classroom. This course casts a wide net, crossing disciplines as it takes us from ancient treatises on the art of poetic composition to modern brain scans, and from centuries-old debates over intellectual property to present-day questions of artificial intelligence. Is creativity the same as originality? Can plagiarism be creative? Should one own the fruits of one's creative labor? What happens in the brain at moments of creative insight? Can creativity be hacked? We will hear directly from practicing artists and experts as we explore these questions through regular, small-stakes creative experiments and a creative final project. By course's end, you will have a deeper sense of where creativity belongs in your own life—and of how you might share what you have discovered with others."

This question was reinvigorated with the 2016 ground-breaking discovery of a habitable planet around the nearest star, Proxima Centauri. A decade of exploration confirmed that such planets are common in our galaxy, and the commonality of habitable planets has raised anew some age-old questions: Where do we come from? What is it to be human? Where are we going? Are we alone in the universe? And last, but not least, what are the dangers of becoming a multi-planet species? Life and planets are intricately linked through geological processes, chemistry, and ultimately, biology, all of which you will explore in this course as we endeavor to answer questions about our place on this planet and beyond. You will gain knowledge of some natural sciences fundamentals while exploring current issues in biotechnology and space exploration technology. This course aims to equip you with both a conceptual understanding of Earth and its place in the universe as well as the quantitative reasoning to think critically about it. Hands-on experiences are central to accomplishing these objectives."

We will begin by spelling out the features of African indigenous religious traditions: cosmology, cosmogony, mythology, ritual practices, divination, healing ceremonies, sacred kingship, etc. We will then explore how these traditions have traveled across the oceans to the new world and how they have contributed to the emergence of new forms of black identities in Brazil, the Caribbean, the USA, and more. This class will equally look at African religious encounters with Islam and Christianity on the continent, resulting in what we often call Africa's Triple Heritage. It then considers African religious sensibilities in the contemporary period, as they relate to the issues of modernity, economic and social development, ethnic and cultural identities, class, and community relations. Finally, we will look at the status of African religion as a global tradition, not necessarily in competition with other religious traditions, but in its relationship to other world religions."

Concentrating on this central human question, we will explore some of the greatest works of ancient Greek literature in English translation. For the Greeks, a special way to address the problem of death was to think long and hard about what they called heroes in their myths. Our purpose in this course is to extend that kind of thinking to the present. Assignments invite you to engage in personal reflections on the meaning of life and death in the light of what we read in Greek literature about the ordeals of becoming a hero."

So why are we still not able to prevent preventable diseases, provide affordable healthcare for millions of people, and deliver cures for curable diseases? And what are the best ways to address these issues? Because these questions are so large, we will focus our discussion around questions like: What steps should be taken to address epidemics? How should the United States reform its health care system? And how should prescription drugs be produced and sold? We will explore how social scientists address empirical questions, the types of data that are available, how those data are analyzed, and the confidence with which causal statements are made. By the end of the course, you will be able to dissect a large question—such as how to reform American healthcare—into its technological, social, economic, and moral components, and weigh potential solutions according to these guiding vectors."

This is, in its simplest and most fundamental formulation, one of the essential teachings of Buddhism. Buddhist communities throughout history have preached, practiced, and written about the ephemerality and illusoriness of our everyday lives and experiences. Ironically, however, many of these same communities have attempted to express these teachings in the form of monumental structures meant to stand the test of time. Some of the world's greatest cultural heritage sites are a legacy of this seeming contradiction between the impermanence that is a central presupposition of Buddhist thought and the permanence to which these same monuments seem to aspire. If the world is characterized by emptiness and the Self is illusory, how does one account for the prodigious volume of art and architecture created by Buddhists throughout history? This Gen Ed course takes a multicultural and reflective engagement with the challenges presented by this conundrum through a study of Buddhist sites scattered throughout time and space. Pertinent topics such as cosmology, pilgrimage, materiality, relics, meditation, and world-making will be explored. Through these Buddhist monuments in South and Southeast Asia, the Himalayas, Central Asia, China, Korea, and Japan, students will learn about the rich, diverse world of Buddhist practice and experience."

A series of wars in the Middle Ages fought between Latin Christians and the perceived enemies of Christendom, the Crusades saw the first experiments of European colonization, the rise of Western commercial capitalism, and the emergence of new cultural identities and boundaries across Europe and the Mediterranean. Students will learn about the origins of the Crusades, the most important expeditions, and the long-term consequences. This course is about the Crusades both in history and in memory, about communities in war and peace, and about stories and memories that have endured to the present day."

Why does the Mexico-U.S. border continue to be a space of discussion and controversy? In the twenty-first century, as nations across the world militarize or rebuild their borders, the U.S.-Mexico border serves as a vital case study to understand the ongoing trend of tightening national borders—it also allows us to better understand our own history, politics, and how we shape our view of the world. In addition to examining the creation of the U.S.-Mexico border in 1848 to the present, this course examines how ideas of public health have historically been used in border debates. For many, the border served (and serves) as a protective barrier from poverty, violence, and, especially, disease. By the early twentieth century many Mexican bodies were perceived as alien, illegal, and in need of patrolling. Yet these descriptions were also used by Mexican politicians to describe and isolate Indigenous groups and the Chinese within Mexico. By examining, for example, border ecological disasters, response to epidemics and a pandemic, and how ideas of race and health played out within Mexico and the U.S. we can better understand borders in general.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences,GENED,1090,What Is a Book? From the Clay Tablet to the Kindle,212857,2026 Spring,4,Tue/Thu,01:30 PM,02:45 PM,David Stern  What,None,Instructor Permission Required,"David Stern What is the nature of the object that has been the focus of your education since you began to read--and at the core of Western culture since its inception-- and why is it important to understand and appreciate its presence before your eyes even if it's all but transparent?You have spent much of your life since kindergarten (and perhaps earlier) reading books; and you will spend much of your time at Harvard continuing to read them. But do you even know what a book is? Is it merely a conveyor, a platform, for presenting a text? Can a book have a use other than being read? Does the nature of the material artifact inscribed with words shape or influence the way you understand their meaning? Do people read a scroll differently than they do a book with pages? Or a digital text on a screen? Why does the physical book persist in the digital age? To answer these questions, we will study the many different material forms in which texts in Western culture have been inscribed—from tablets to e-books—and the technologies that have enabled their creation. We will also explore every possible aspect of the object we know as a book, from the title page to the index, and from the layout of a page to the use of illustrations and decorations—and what each of these features of the book can tell us about its historical role, how readers have used the book, and what it has meant to them. Books we will look at will range from the Bible to Vesalius, from Homer to Harold and His Purple Crayon. Sections will visit the Weissman Preservation Center, Houghton Library, Fine Arts Special Collections, and the Harvard Art Museum, and all students will be required to study a manuscript close-up and participate in a printing workshop. The book as a material object is the focus of the course. The capstone project will be the creation of a (short) book by each student and an accompanying paper explaining its place in the history of the book in the West.After taking this course, you will never look at a book in the same way."

Puett What if many of our assumptions about the self and about how to live fully are limiting and even dangerous, and what other possibilities might we be able to find in classical Chinese philosophy?What is the best way to live a fuller and more ethical life? Concretely what should we do to begin to live in a more flourishing and inspiring way? Questions such as these were at the heart of philosophical debates in China. The answers that classical Chinese thinkers developed in response to these questions are among the most powerful in human history. Regardless of whether one agrees with them or not, they should be studied and taken seriously by anyone who cares about ethics, politics, and the ways to live life more fully."

What is the relationship between rising economic inequality and rising political partisanship? How has ongoing partisan polarization and the design of our political institutions affected U.S. responses to social issues?

It is about people. It is about those pushed to the margins, whose lives are ground down by poverty, trapped by unjust systems, and devalued by forces that declare some lives worth less than others. This course challenges students to reimagine disease, illness, and injury as biosocial phenomena—shaped as much by poverty, racism, and political violence as by pathogens. From rural Malawi to American prisons, from tuberculosis programs to the overdose crisis, we will trace the roots of global health inequities and examine the ideologies that sustain them. But this course is not only about identifying failures. It is about how we stand alongside the sick and destitute to fight for a future where health is a human right."

These catastrophes claim thousands of lives and cause tens of billions of dollars in damage each year, and the impact of natural disasters is only increasing as a result of human population growth and urbanization. This course uses the methods and skills associated with earth science to help you to develop an understanding of both the causes and impacts of these events. Readings will be assigned from the textbook Natural Disasters by Patrick Abbott (11th edition), to deliver the scientific content - recorded lectures will be available throughout the course, and live lectures and discussion sessions will be held each week to address any difficulties with the material, to facilitate discussion, and to provide an opportunity for interacting with fellow students and the teaching staff. By the end of this course, you will be able to understand the ways in which societies can systematically anticipate and prepare for the kinds of natural disasters which many people have come to assume are inevitable."

How accurate are these depictions? Does it matter? This course examines the quintessential example of the exotic, mysterious ancient world – Ancient Egypt – to explore these questions. Who has used ancient Egypt as a construct, and to what purpose? Did you know that pyramids, mummies, King Tut, and Cleopatra represent just the (overhyped) tip of a very rich civilization that holds plenty of life lessons for today? Combine the ancient Egyptians' explanations of the world's natural forces with all the social complexity of human interaction and you have a fully formed society—about four millennia of accumulated experience! Can investigating the real ancient Egypt unpack our current misconceptions about the land of the pharaohs? Hardly morose, tomb-building zombies, the Egyptians embraced life in all its messy details. Piety and corruption, imperialism and isolationism, divinity and mortality all played significant roles in life along the Nile. What can we learn about the nature of politics and society in our time by seeing the parallels between the ancient past and today? We will explore archaeology, modern Egyptomania, repatriation, new digital visualization technologies, and international politics. What was ancient Egyptian racism? What is modern archaeological racism? Who owns the past? Who needs it? We will take excursions into Egyptian art, history, politics, religion, literature and language (hieroglyphs), plus the evolution of Egyptology as a discipline. Field trips to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Peabody Museum, and the Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East (formerly Harvard Semitic Museum) are included, along with the famous Giza Pyramids in 3D. Students will gain a transformative appreciation for the outstanding monuments and intellectual traditions of ancient Egypt. And with newly broadened horizons, we will debunk many popular myths."

When, why, and how do people, and whole nations, come to together to influence large-scale policies and actions on issues like the environment, equality, criminal justice? Why do revolutions occur? This course will try to answer these questions, and do so by exploring a diversity of efforts related to societal change. In an effort to draw general lessons for those interested in making change, we will assess a range of political and legal approaches; examine mass movements and the leadership by organizations, governments, and individuals; and attempt to gauge outcomes. Using research from psychology, political science, and economics, and focusing on case studies, the course will explore the ideas behind several arguments: 1) big problems are rarely resolved with comparably big solutions, but instead are better met with small acts of reform; 2) coalition-building among strange bedfellows is usually indispensable; 3) agents of change fare best when they look to measure their impact and never lose sight of the real world results they seek, rather than the expressive highs along the way; 4) informational cascades are possible and critical, as people follow one another; and 5) group polarization can be both desirable and dangerous, as groups become more heated and more extreme."

Whether you are a skilled chef or a home-cook, what you do in the kitchen is deeply rooted in science. This class brings together top chefs and Harvard scientists to explore how everyday cooking and haute cuisine can illuminate basic principles in physics and chemistry. Throughout the semester you will watch as chefs reveal the secrets behind some of their most famous culinary creations. Inspired by such cooking mastery, we will then explore the science behind the recipes. Students will gain a solid understanding of the properties and fundamental behaviors of soft matter materials. All food is made of soft materials, and cooking relies on many of their fundamental properties. Topics will include: emulsions, illustrated by aioli; elasticity, exemplified by the done-ness of a steak; and diffusion, revealed by the phenomenon of spherification, the culinary technique pioneered by Ferran Adria. The course includes laboratory work where students develop their skills as experimental scientists. Other assignments include weekly homeworks, in-class exercises, and a final project where students explore the science of a culinary topic of their choosing. chefs."

How do you know? Even though today we take great pains to document every major event that occurs, more than 99% of human history is not written down. How, then, can we determine with any certainty what people did, let alone thought about, hundreds, thousands, and even millions of years ago? This course addresses these and other fundamental questions: Can we ever really know what happened in the past? If the past is dead and gone, how do we know what we (think we) know about it? And what is our degree of certainty about the past societies and cultures that historians, archaeologists and others study today? Through hands-on interaction with artifacts, experiments and other analytical methods you will consider how these approaches relate to different stakeholders – groups of people whose understanding of themselves is rooted in a connection to history.

We are the only ones who expend tremendous amounts of time, energy, and resources trying (sometimes obsessively) to understand our futures before they happen. While the innate ability of individual people to predict has not changed much in the past few millennia, developments in mathematical and conceptual models have inordinately improved predictive systems. These systems have integrated comparisons to past results and quantified how certain we can be about various aspects of the future -- processes that were, in many cases, inconceivable at one point in the past. This course is a coordinated investigation of the history and future of prediction, beginning with Ancient Mesopotamians reading signs in sheep entrails and ending with modern computer simulations for climate, health, wealth, and the fate of our Universe. In this class, you will design your own predictive systems to critically engage with assumptions about how the world works and situate your explorations in a study of how motivations and techniques for divining the future have changed–and not changed–throughout human history."

It is a practice of embodied making, and, as a language outside of words, can think around conditioned understanding. This introductory studio art course proposes learning to paint as a new experience of relating to the world, and through painting we will investigate not only what we have to say, but what we have to see.Studio assignments in small sections are complemented by weekly lectures, visiting artist presentations, readings and visits to Harvard's collections.

What defines slavery in the modern world, and what are the moral, political and social implications of its continued existence? As we explore its underpinnings, we discover that all of us may be in some way complicit in its survival. This course surveys the nature, types and extent of modern servitude such as transnational and domestic prostitution, forced marriage, labor trafficking and forced domestic labor, child soldiering and other forms of enslavement of children, organ trafficking and other health aspects of trafficking, debt-bondage, and the forced exploitation of other vulnerable groups such as refugees and stateless persons. Throughout the course, but especially in the final part, we examine anti-trafficking and anti-slavery measures and movements and ways in which you can increase awareness or become involved. You will, by the end of our exploration, be able to trace the moral and ethical arguments surrounding human slavery in its various forms, understand the ways in which this problem still affects so many people, and what can and should be done about it."

What is the right balance between national sovereignty and international integration? Is the US equipped to sustain its role as a global leader? How does international trade affect prosperity and inequality? Should we regulate multi-national companies who move their factories to countries with lower labor standards? How should the IMF respond to financial crises in Europe and the developing world? How will the rise of China change the world system? This course uses basic economic logic to illuminate the choices - and trade-offs - faced by governments, international institutions, businesses, and citizens as the global economy evolves. Our course is based on the premise that passion without careful reason is dangerous and that reliance on solid analytics and rigorous empirical evidence will lead to a better world. The professors and guest speakers debate policy issues in class, and students will participate in simulated negotiations, experiencing the issues firsthand, as well as illustrating the importance of decisions made by individual actors for the evolution of the global system."

Small losses most of us learn to bear with equanimity. But enormous, wrenching, life- changing losses open voids in our lives for which we can never feel adequately prepared, even if we can see them coming. This course tries to understand the nature of loss on a physical and emotional level, to give us some framework for coping with it and to help us develop some empathy in those very difficult situations when someone else has faced a loss and we do not know how to react. Our main focus will be upon the loss of someone close to us, through either death or a personality-changing accident or illness (close is in quotation marks, because some of these losses may be of public figures whom we have never met personally, but whose loss makes an impact on our entire society). We will compare this form of loss with others, such as loss of country through exile or forced migration and loss of part of oneself through amputation. Our approach will be threefold: we will try to understand the physiological and psychological effects of loss; we will study the rituals that different societies have evolved to mark loss and memorialize the lost; and we will analyze literary, musical, artistic, and architectural expressions of loss, chiefly great works, but also some quite humble attempts to record the emotional rupture that loss entails. We will work on a broad canvas, both spatially and chronologically, looking at testimonies as various as Cicero's reactions to the death of his adult daughter; interviews with refugees from the war in Syria; and poetry inspired by the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial. We will read four books: the memoir of a survivor of the tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004; a novel about a woman's gradual loss of her mental capacity to Alzheimer's Disease; and the accounts of two great twentieth-century authors, C. S. Lewis and Joan Didion, each struggling to survive the loss of their spouse. We will encounter tombstones with simple inscriptions commemorating the death of family pets from the Roman world and set these in the context of scientific research on the human-animal bond. We will study prayers for the dead in the major faith traditions, and visit (virtually) the Rothko Chapel in Houston, Texas, to consider the therapeutic effects of the somber walls of its octagonal interior. We will study photographs by Dorothea Lange documenting poverty and hopelessness during the Depression. We will learn how to listen to a Requiem Mass, whether we encounter it in a sacred building or (more likely) a concert hall. By the end of the course, which will have ranged far beyond these few examples, we will have gained a deeper understanding of the effects of loss on us both individually and collectively, and of the rituals and therapies that different societies have developed over time to mark and manage it. And we will have learned how fragile is the nature of what we love, and how much we should cherish it while we have the chance."

Bol, William Kirby What does China's past mean for its and your future as China once again becomes the most powerful nation on earth?A century ago, the world was dominated by great empires—multinational, multicultural entities that spanned ethnic and geographic divides. But of all those empires—the Austro-Hungarian, the Russian, the Ottoman, the British and French colonial empires, and the Great Qing Empire of the Manchus—only the Great Qing survives, now reincarnated as the Chinese national state.In China today we see a new country built on the bedrock of an ancient civilization. It is in the midst of the most extraordinary economic transformation the world has seen. This development comes on top of the political, social, and cultural revolutions of the 20th century. All these changes occur against a deep historical background still much in evidence.This course explores how the world's largest and oldest bureaucratic state has dealt with enduring problems of economic and political organization. It will show how even modern answers to these challenges bear the imprint of China's history. We will explore intellectual and religious trends, material and political culture, the tension between local society and the center, art and literature, and China's multiple economic and political transformations. The consequences of the ancient Chinese political ideal of a single, civilized world empire is a central theme of the course, both from the comparative perspective of other multi-ethnic empires and in terms of the ever-broadening scope and intensity of China's global connections. We will draw comparisons with Rome between the 2nd century BCE to the 2nd century CE; with Romanov and Soviet realms in the 17th century and 20th centuries, respectively; and with Western global empires of the age of high imperialism in 19th and 20th centuries. All these empires have come and gone, while a unitary, multi-national, Chinese empire has endured.On one hand, this has been a history of conflict, in which Chinese empires used military force to control the peoples on their borders. When they failed, border peoples incorporated China into their own inland empires: the Mongols in the 13th century and Manchus in the 17th. On the other hand, it has been a history of economic and cultural relations, in which China absorbed foreign models (Buddhism from India in the 3rd century; the sovereign nation-state system from the West in the 19th century; and both industrial capitalism and Stalinist socialism in the 20th century), defended trade by land along the Eurasian silk routes and by sea with South and Southeast Asia, and put itself forward as a model state for others in East Asia and beyond.The course will enable students to debate how the choices China has made in the past bear on the challenges it faces today, when a modern China model, with ancient roots, competes with the United States for global leadership.The course is taught with multiple pedagogies. By shifting lecture to on-line modules that include field trips to sites in China, class time is focused on active, participant-centered learning around major texts, works of art, and contemporary case studies. Class preparation and attendance are mandatory. Assignments include responses to online modules, weekly sections, a midterm examination, and a final group project.

But seldom do we stop to think about what a border is, or when and why some borders are defended more aggressively than others. This course looks at the modern history of borders, broadly construed, from national boundaries between sovereign countries, to supranational agreements such as the European Union. It considers how borders are erected and dissolved, both legally and materially. And it queries the legal, diplomatic, social, and ethical considerations that ensue from drawing a line between one side and another, and defending that line. We will also consider how actors within societies create internal (often racialized) boundary lines such as gated communities or redlined zones, that are sometimes extra-legal or even illegal, but have profound effects on the everyday lives of individuals and groups."

Participants will learn how to analyze moving images and the ways they influence us – a basic media literacy that we all need for life in a media- saturated society. Additionally we will learn how culture, in this case moving images, flows across the globe and transforms its meaning in site-specific ways. We will see how Japanese cinema's use of slow motion entered the American gangster film, or how samurai films helped create the Italian Spaghetti Westerns, and many other examples. How do moving images constantly nudge us into a specific worldview, and how does the global circulation of these media subtly shift those nudges in unexpected ways? What does it mean that we nonetheless share a common media memory despite living in very different parts of the world?

But what--if anything--is American about American food? What does food tell us about the American past and what might that past indicate about food today? How have food and eating changed over time? How have individual food choices and national food policies connected Americans to the larger world, both the social or political worlds of other human beings and the natural world of all other living beings?

Water. This course introduces students to the terrestrial water cycle: how it works, how humans manipulate it, and how it manipulates us. Students will learn about the major components of the terrestrial water cycle, including precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff and streamflow, and saturated and unsaturated subsurface flow. We will also learn about the causes and consequences of natural hazards associated with the water cycle -- including floods, landslides and droughts – and examine several case studies, with a focus on human impacts. The course will consider how the water cycle has contributed to the demise of past civilizations, and explore implications for modern society in a warming world."

In this course, students will gain an in-depth understanding of how North America turned from a minor outpost of the Atlantic economy into the powerhouse of the world economy, how Americans built a capitalist economy and how that capitalism, in turn, changed every aspect of their lives. In the process, they will come to understand how contemporary capitalism is the result of centuries of human engagement, struggle, and aspirations. Topics range from the structure of Native-American economies to the economic consequences of the Civil War; from the impact of capitalism on gender relations to the changing structures of American businesses; and from the position of the United States in the world economy to the role of the government in channeling economic development. Boston merchants and Georgia sharecroppers, enslaved cotton growers and reforming statesmen, workers at the Ford assembly line and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs will all appear in the story. The course will put particular emphasis on the global context of American economic development and situate it deeply in political and social changes. Ultimately, students will gain an understanding of how the contemporary capitalism that so powerfully shapes all of our lives has emerged over the course of several centuries, and how the tools to understand the history of American capitalism can be applied to understanding our contemporary situation. Assignments in particular will encourage students to think about contemporary problems from historical perspectives."

Through direct purchase and through the collecting activity of numerous alumnae/i, we began collecting all sorts of texts and artifacts generated by the medieval world of Arabic, Greek, and Latin civilizations. The things that arrived in Harvard's collections came in many forms, ranging from great architectural monuments and motifs to little stuff such as belt buckles, pilgrims' flasks, and fragments of pottery. Why did we want medieval stuff? And what have we since learned about the world from which it came? This is a course about objects and their meaning, focusing on the objects in Harvard's collections that derive from western Eurasia and North Africa between the fall of the Roman Empire to the eve of contact with the New World. The five modules in the course begin by introducing you to five objects—things, images, texts—in Harvard's collections. Each of these objects lies on the edges of canonical knowledge and therefore pose mysteries and invite questions. Our own exploration starts with the context of the object's acquisition and briefly explores what was happening in the world at the moment of its arrival. What did the acquisition of the medieval mean a hundred years ago? From there, we plunge into the past to explore the objects in their own context, working to grasp technologies, economies, social relations, and beliefs. Among other topics, we explore how medieval people imagined saints, miracles and witchcraft, as well as hell and other nasty regions of the afterworld. We explore trade networks and power structures and beliefs about others. We see how medieval peoples mapped visions of their own world, and work our way into the deep inner structures of their cognition, such as their understandings of time and calendar. Starting from the particular and moving to the general, lectures and assignments seek to frame the cultural context of each object and model how students can develop the skills they need to unpack and explain the unfamiliar. A major course-long assignment will invite students to make their own discoveries in Harvard's collections and elsewhere and to curate their own virtual gallery of objects that engages with the medieval world. The semester ends with a concrete proposal to the museum regarding areas of the collection that we need to build up to promote the concerns and issues of our own day."
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,GENED,1161,"If There Is No God, All Is Permitted: Theism and Moral Reasoning",218237,2026 Spring,4,Tue/Thu,12:00 PM,01:15 PM,Jay Harris Can,None,,"Jay Harris Can we have confidence that our moral claims are true?For centuries in the West, Jewish and Christian thinkers (among others) have asserted that moral judgment is impossible without some concept of the deity. So convincing were they that one important character created by a Russian author of the nineteenth century was led to express the idea (if not exactly the words), if there is no God, all is permitted. In more recent times some thinkers have challenged this assumption, and insisted that removing (or reducing) the role of God is indispensable to proper moral discourse. This course will examine the ways in which a concept of God has informed Western moral discourse, trying to help students engage the literature as they confront the basic question, why might one think if there is no God, all is permitted? and why might one think if there is a God human moral achievement is diminished or impossible. Further, we will examine ways in which the differing paradigms actually affect the moral conclusions we might generate.Belief in God and denial of God's existence have each figured prominently in Western moral discourse. Arguments have been advanced that: autonomous human reasoning is incapable of arriving at moral truths without a supreme principle to ground the system (which is sometimes invested with personality and called God); that autonomous human reasoning can have no impact on moral behavior due to human failure that only God can correct; that autonomous moral reasoning is impossible, and morality can only be understood as the submission to the will of a superior moral being; that a concept of God is necessary to direct and regulate moral reasoning, but the actual confessional versions of theism are metaphysically implausible or impossible; that autonomous human moral reasoning is impossible with God, and thus only a-theism can lead to moral conclusions. This course will engage all these different themes."

We're gonna sing it anyway. So sings Hermes at the start of Hadestown, the hit broadway show that deals with capitalism, demagoguery, borders, and climate change. Based on the ancient artform of tragedy, this musical provokes its audiences to reflect on very modern concerns; it also, as the show's creator Anaïs Mitchell says, lets us cry. This course is about how and why ancient Greek tragedy provides such a powerful lens for exploring some of today's most pressing sociopolitical issues. In Athens in the fifth century BCE, thousands would gather at the theater to grapple, through the medium of tragedy, with questions that continue to preoccupy us today: What happens if a woman is in power? How different are we from foreigners? Or what happens to the victims of war? 2500 years later, ancient Greek tragedy is all around us, from Broadway to hip hop to Game of Thrones to TV advertisements. Its adaptations can expose forms of inequity: Luis Alfaro's play Oedipus el Rey, for example, highlights incarceration rates among Latinx communities in 21st-century America. They can examine recent historical events that have fundamentally affected our understandings of race, conflict, and immigration, from Apartheid and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa (Yaël Farber's Molora) to the ongoing civil war in Syria (Queens of Syria). They can also provide models for explorations of identity—as we can see when Freddie Mercury becomes Dionysus in Queen's iconic video for I Want to Break Free. In this course you will read, watch, and listen to some of the most recent reincarnations of ancient Greek tragedies alongside the original plays. You will think about how such an old artform can change how we respond to 21st-century problems, and how it can make us think differently about ourselves."

What is the good China story? Is this the story China should tell about itself to the world? Is this about cultural self-perception, understanding the world, cross-cultural communication, or simple propaganda? More importantly, how can we tell China stories from perspectives outside of China?What seems beyond dispute is the power of stories to bring China to the world and the world to China. In exploring the fictional turn of contemporary Chinese cultural politics as it relates to the world, we will also trace its genealogy to earlier historical moments. Stories matter in China, not only in our times but also throughout history.Narrative fiction is one of the most effective ways to engage with the Chinese past and the Chinese present. Instead of presenting China as a monolithic civilization, this course uses stories to understand the world of China and China in the world from ideological, ethnic, cultural, and geo-political perspectives. The course highlights the variety and vitality of stories from both modern and pre-modern periods. In genres ranging from religious allegory to science fiction, from moral fable to fantastic romance, from philosophical anecdote to political satire, Chinese stories have enlightened, intrigued, puzzled, and scandalized readers, reflecting and constructing ever-changing worldviews."

For scientists, this means that future geologists will be able to see the effects of human activities - climate change, biodiversity loss, plastic - in the stratigraphic record and thereby distinguish this epoch from the ones that came before. But what does this mean for us, as humans living at a time where millions of species are threatened with extinction, where lead pollution reaches every corner of the globe, where endocrine-disrupting chemicals threaten our sexual identity, and climate change potentially threatens the end of the world as we know it? How will we live in a world where--as the United Church of Christ Minister James Antal has put it--nature appears to have turned against us and it may feel as if we are truly alone? Is it ethical to be happy while the world around us is falling apart? Is it possible? This course will explore the diverse meanings of the Anthropocene, from scientific, technological, literary, philosophical, cultural, theological and personal perspectives, in an attempt to answer the question: What will it mean to live and die in the Anthropocene?"

In this course, we'll learn how sexual identity and desire are understood and represented in different social and historical circumstances. We'll move beyond the binary of identifying images as positive or negative, paying attention to how depictions, definitions, and understandings of sexuality are shaped by specific historical moments, as well as the aesthetic traditions and personal experiences shaping these individual works. Along the way, we'll unpack terms such as intersectionality, feminist, and queer. We'll think carefully about how the evolving nature of language and terminology—for instance, the shift from same-sex marriage to marriage equality—affects political discourse and shapes our understanding of what is possible. In addition to novels, we'll look at op-eds, essays, poems, plays, photography, performance art, and film with an eye to thinking about how different genres speak to the larger world of politics, activism, citizenship, rights, and popular culture. Learning how to decode metaphors and images in novels, films, and other works will make you a more sophisticated reader of the texts that circulate outside the classroom. As you sharpen your ability to critically analyze these works as products of particular political and historical moments, you will become a more nuanced reader of the world around you, able to think critically about other texts (not only literature, but memes, videos, blogs, games, tweets, and advertising) that circulate in our own cultural moment and their crucial relationship to identity and social change."

The relation is complicated rather than simple, problematic rather than straightforward. To begin to explore this question, we discuss key theoretical issues and illuminating examples that begin to sketch out an approach to linking language, culture, and society. Specifically, we consider the following problems: How is language use a kind of social action? (It is something we do; it has social effects.) How does language organize and provide access to shared concepts and beliefs? (It has something to do with the way we collaborate, socially, to represent, reflect upon, and think about the world.) How do speakers think about and reflect upon language, and how do these reflections affect how they use it? (We have presuppositions about what language is and rely on these notions to orient to and situate ourselves within social worlds).Throughout the course, we develop a set of powerful analytical tools for studying both language and culture and, ultimately, for defining their role in social life."

We will examine Mexico's diversity of food, drink, and cultures across time and space with evidence from archaeology, anthropology, climatology, botany, genetics, history, and more, to investigate how and why various changes in Mexican cuisine took place. The origins of menu items like tacos, burritos, guacamole, and margaritas reveal critical changes in global foodways—not just in Mexico—that continue to shape our everyday lives and the world as we know it today. You will leave this course with a better understanding of where your own food comes from, and how you have been impacted by changes in food and food culture, both in the distant past and more recently, as well as how some Mexican food practices are influencing models for healthier and more sustainable food systems.We all need to eat and drink each day to nourish our bodies. Yet how often do you pause to think deeply about why you eat what you eat? Your food habits are likely influenced by family traditions, but also by a range of other factors like income, ethnicity, religion, politics, and the environment, which are facets of our lives deeply rooted in the past. What does the food we eat tell us about ourselves, as individuals, communities, and countries, and has humanity's relationship with food changed over time?

Yet what if it made you stronger? In the case of Armenia, being in-between led to a vibrant, diverse, and resilient culture, a distinctive religious and national identity, and a dynamic diaspora. Travelling from antiquity to modernity, we will explore how Armenia and Armenians survived and thrived despite invasion, oppression, statelessness, and planned annihilation. We will explore the connections between Armenian culture and diverse traditions, including classical antiquity, the Ancient Near East, Sasanian and Islamic Iran, and the Byzantine empire, East Asia, and Europe, and the relations between Armenia and neighboring cultures of the Caucasus. We will follow the Armenian experience into the early modern period, when Armenians established a trade network reaching from the Indian subcontinent to Amsterdam, absorbing and informing a kaleidoscope of cultures along the way. We will wrap up with the survival of Armenian traditions in contemporary culture, the role of the Armenian genocide in shaping Armenian identity, including in neighboring Watertown. Finally, we will discuss the meaning of cultural heritage for Armenians today, and explore its role at the intersection of politics, diplomacy, law, scholarship, human rights, and activism."

This course pursues two guiding questions: how has anxiety changed throughout history and how has it stayed the same? And how have authors throughout history productively channeled anxiety into creating beautiful and meaningful works of art? Through a combination of readings and fieldwork, we'll investigate anxiety's potential causes, from the universal fear of death to the more historical contexts of urbanization and self-optimization, for instance, as well as its various treatments, such as stoicism, self-help, and psychopharmacology. The course combines practical and theoretical perspectives to examine the relation between anxiety and creativity and to engage with various aesthetic responses—from comedy to literature and film—to the troubles of being that anxiety designates. Smaller weekly assignments will include slow reading, technological unplugging, and proposing one improvement to the mental health culture on campus. Final project may be scholarly, creative, or a hybrid of both. Students will emerge from class readings and discussions with an understanding of anxiety as a social formation, literary preoccupation, and, when harnessed, a spur to aesthetic invention and political intervention.

As a taxpayer, voter, or parent, you will be connected with formal schooling. You will almost certainly be in the role of teacher at various points in your life, whether in a classroom, in another professional setting, or guiding someone in something you love to do. Leaders in any field are teachers and coaches--they develop the people around them to bring their full potential to some shared ambition. You will also be in the role of learner throughout your life in a variety of forms and contexts. Precisely because we are all learners and teachers and we've all had some direct experience with K-12 schools, everyone has interests and opinions about schools. Yet, U.S. K-12 schools are consistently failing to serve all children well. This course will prepare you to recognize the assumptions, binaries, and controversies that drive much of the sound and substance of U.S. K-12 education, and replace those with a different ABCs: awareness, both-and thinking, and context. Learning can get lost in all the noise of education.

This course investigates this question by introducing students to the nature of philanthropy and nonprofit organizations, and their influence on civil society. Most moral and religious frameworks uphold some form of benevolence and charity, yet societies differ in their views of philanthropy and nonprofits. We will consider social scientific perspectives on charitable giving and apply them to topics like competing philosophies of giving and the relationship between philanthropic and state programs. Issues of social responsibility for billionaire and corporate philanthropic actors will also be addressed.The course offers two unique activity-based learning opportunities to gain skills and experience. First, students will work in groups to identify and evaluate nonprofits as potential recipients of a donation provided by the Philanthropy Lab. They will assess how a donation could impact these organizations. Second, through a partnership with the Lemann Program on Creativity and Entrepreneurship, student groups will develop their own nonprofit ventures. Ventures will receive startup funding, and successful teams will compete for additional funding. The course will also offer guest lectures and workshops on entrepreneurship to support venture development. Through class discussions and hands-on activities, students will gain an understanding of how charitable giving and nonprofit work can be leveraged to create positive social change."

Technological innovation is all around us, and new possibilities in fields like artificial intelligence, genome-editing and geoengineering not only reallocate power, but might transform human life itself considerably, to the point of modifying the essence of what it is to be human. While ethical considerations enter prominently, the philosophy of technology is broader than its ethics. It aims to interpret and critically assess the role of technology for human life and guide us to a more thoughtful integration of technology in our individual lives and in public decision making. This course aims to teach you to do just that, starting with basic stances and key figures in the field and then progressing towards a number of challenges around specific types of technology as they arise for the 21st century. At times it is tech optimism that dominates these debates (sometimes even techno-boosterism that sees technology as key to heaven on earth), at other times it is more low-spirited attitudes from Romantic uneasiness to doom-and-gloom Luddism and technology-bashing. A closer look at these attitudes – alongside reflection on how technology and power are intertwined – will help generate a more skeptical attitude towards all of them and contribute to more level-headed debates, which are badly needed."

To understand a people's foodways (including what people like to eat or drink, and how they like to prepare it) is to gain insight into how they view themselves, interact with each other, and conceptualize their relationships with other communities.

Beyond the walls of museum galleries, creative expression exists all around us in surprisingforms, shaped through individual and communal creation. In this course, you will learn to recognize and evaluate diverse expressions of traditional culture, from Harvard Lore to annual family traditions, to community festivals, to social media culture. Course readings introduce youto a variety of traditional texts (forms of expressive traditional culture); contexts (the sites and occasions where traditional expressive culture is performed); and textures (aesthetics, or the culturally informed, group-based parameters that shape traditional culture). You will completesmall collection projects to look for and describe expressive traditions, and these exercises will culminate in your own capstone ethnographic project in which you document, analyze, and creatively present an expressive tradition of your choice.

In our modern global economies, different markets are internationally intertwined, as technological advances have allowed for swift communication and economic dependence between practically all areas of the world. The shipping industry might be a salient example of this, where one cargo ship got stuck in the Suez Canal in 2021 and blocked the channel for six days, stranding ca. 400 vessels and delaying between $6 and $10 billion in trade per day, attesting to the importance of this trade route for the global economy. Yet, the use of this route for large scale long-distance sea voyages can be traced back at least to the Roman period, where there is evidence of cargo ships traveling from Muziris, India to the Red Sea Coast of Egypt, carrying with them 635 tonnes of cargo meant to travel all the way to Alexandria and Rome, and worth around 7 million Roman sesterces, the equivalent of the salary of seven senators at the time. In this case the ancient and the modern don't seem so different.By analyzing the global connections of well- known ancient civilizations such as the Assyrian, Egyptian, Macedonian, Roman, and Palmyrene Empires, students will learn to see similarities to our own current global economic enterprises and learn not only of the challenges but also the social injustices and exploitation that take place in these global enterprises. Another particularly poignant example is the week where we study ancient global pandemics, seeing the ways in which they affected the labor force, the lower classes, agricultural production, and even politics, much like during our recent COVID-19 pandemic.Furthermore, students will learn how to dissect historical and analytical narratives that utilize quantitative and qualitative data sets through selected case studies spanning millennia between them. For example, the class covers the economic logistics of the military conquests of Alexander, the constructions of the pyramids of Old Kingdom Egypt, the economic and human price of urban development of the city of Rome, and the capital investment and merchant networks required for the long-distance trade along the Silk Roads and Indian Ocean trade routes.

Yet, we often fail to examine the implicit assumptions and approaches underlying our learning. In addition, we often overlook the importance of unlearning – the process of letting go of inaccurate information, misguided beliefs, harmful biases, limiting mindsets, and unproductive habits to make room for new learning. Unlearning has always been essential for replacing outdated and simplistic ideas with updated and sophisticated ones. Today, it has become even more critical due to contemporary challenges such as societal polarization and media echo chambers, the impact of generative AI and other technologies on traditional practices, the necessity for challenging the status quo to envision a more just society, and the urgent need for dialogue, understanding, and empathy in an increasingly tribalistic world. Intentionally examining the purposes and processes of learning and unlearning will help us become more effective (un)learners, and ultimately, illuminate how these processes can foster human flourishing in our current world and for future generations. In this course, we will engage with fundamental questions and debates, including:What does it mean to learn and unlearn? How do individuals prioritize the diverse purposes of learning, such as cultivating intellect, developing moral values, fostering personal growth, preparing for citizenship, and beyond? How do our experiences and cultural contexts influence our understanding of learning? How do we learn, and why do we learn in the ways that we do? When do we feel motivated or demotivated? How do schools nurture or stifle children's natural curiosity? Do students learn better through teachers' instruction or independent exploration? How do we monitor, evaluate, and adjust our own learning processes? How might generative AI be used to support or hinder learning? How do we decide what is worth learning and what should be unlearned? Why do we struggle to change our minds and habits, and what strategies can effectively facilitate this transformation? We will examine the cognitive, metacognitive or self-reflective, emotional, social, and moral dimensions of learning and unlearning. We will use a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary lens, analyzing cases from East Asian and Western cultures and draw insights from psychology, neuroscience, education, and philosophy. Class sessions are highly interactive and emphasize active learning. Students will engage in a range of activities including lectures, discussions, debates, case studies, interviews, group teaching exercise, storytelling, guest speaker sessions, and reflections on both personal learning processes and the pedagogical design of this course.

Whether from the Left or the Right of the political spectrum, if statements about political opponents are to be believed, there are Nazis everywhere. Leaving aside such facile comparisons and analogies, this course offers an in-depth case study of Germany's path from a democracy full of promise and possibility to that democracy's collapse into tyranny, war, and the Holocaust. We will work extensively with primary sources including contemporary eye witness accounts, political and economic commentary, art, and literature to explore the rise of National Socialism in the context of the politics, culture, and economics of Germany after the First World War before turning to the way the Nazis managed to seize the state, remake German society after 1933, and plunge Europe into war and genocide by the end of the decade. The course will debunk the many myths about the roots of Nazism and work towards an explanation of its rise that does justice to the complexities of lived experience between the two World Wars. With an eye towards the active nature of democratic citizenship, the course will emphasize the many junctures at which the ascend of National Socialism could have been prevented by people from the various corners of interwar Germany's political spectrum.

How has writing attempted to appropriate musical and vocal effects across different epochs and different cultures?

Less often invoked, however, is an older, more metaphysical notion of 'nature naturing' actively (natura naturans). When (if ever) did the concept of the 'environment' replace that of nature? What are the exact differences between the terms we use to refer to the planet as our shared home, whether 'nature,' '(e/E)arth,' 'world,' 'environment,' 'planet,' or 'globe'? And what ramifications might the semantic shifts between these six terms have for current environmental debates?] This interdisciplinary course asks these questions by examining three phases in the history of the idea of nature as instigated by key German poets, thinkers, and visual artists. Beginning with the period around 1800, we will reconstruct the tensions animating Romanticism's holistic conception of nature by reading works by Kant, Goethe, Schelling, and Alexander von Humboldt, while the landscape paintings of Caspar David Friedrich will furnish our artistic case study. Turning to the first half of the twentieth century, we will encounter the first use of the German term Umwelt ('environment') in its modern sense in the work of theoretical biologist Jakob von Uexküll, who was friends with the poet Rainer Maria Rilke. We will reconstruct Martin Heidegger's critique of modern technology and compare and contrast his conception of the artwork's ties to 'earth' and 'world' vis-à-vis comparison to Schelling's theory of the artwork's relation to nature. Our exemplary artist for this second phase is Paul Klee, who grounded his aesthetic vision in nature's formative processes. Approaching our contemporary moment, we will read literary works by W.G. Selbald while attending to the political and communicative vicissitudes of coming to societal awareness of a transhistorical phenomenon such as climate change. Joseph Beuys's politico-aesthetic agitations and the first photos of the Earth taken from outer space provide our last artistic case studies.

It existentializes Aristotle's ontology, systematizes the existential insights of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, and on that basis offers a radical critique of Husserl's phenomenological account of intentionality. The result is a dramatically original and compelling interpretation of the human condition. This interpretation leads, in turn, to an account of the nature of philosophical and scientific inquiry, as well as their limitations. Being and Time has important implications for all those disciplines that study human beings. In this course we will explore major themes of this often bewildering work, with an emphasis on charitable interpretation: What is the 'question of Being?' What is the relationship between theoretical knowledge and understanding-by-doing? What is the nature of our social being? What does it mean to be 'inauthentic' or 'authentic,' and what are the implications of human finitude? Finally, what is the 'Question of Being'? both.

During the 17th century, Amsterdam rapidly transformed into Europe's global trading hub and political powerhouse of the emerging Dutch Republic. It nurtured some of the period's greatest luminaries, including Rembrandt, Descartes and Spinoza. Long celebrated for its religious tolerance, artistic innovation and economic modernity, Amsterdam's golden age also became notorious for its involvement with slave trade and military repression in Asia, Africa, and the Americas. This course seeks to probe these ambiguous characteristics of the city and to identify their possible interconnections. For this purpose, we will assess a variety of written and visual source material, including pamphlets, diaries and travel accounts as well as prints, paintings and material objects. These sources will enable students to gain a deeper understanding of early modern urban culture and to consider the use of visual evidence in historical scholarship.

But it is of cardinal importance to comprehending the outbreak of the 'Settler Revolution' that came on the heels of the great material and political convulsions of the late eighteenth century. Though lesser known than its American, French or Industrial counterparts, the mass exodus of willing (and unwilling) migrants in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars was no less revolutionary in its impact. The formidable scale, unprecedented reach and dogged persistence of this global phenomenon are by no means self-explanatory. Fundamental to making sense of 'settlerism' is the concept of global modernity – that potent mix of technological innovation, economic dynamism, hypermobility and destructive physical force that transformed the nineteenth-century world. Though the term itself is contested (and its core characteristics disputed) few would deny the step change in long-range capabilities that made colonizing the farthest ends of the earth a viable proposition.Fundamental to making sense of 'settlerism' is the concept of global modernity – that potent mix of technological innovation, economic dynamism, hypermobility and destructive physical force that transformed the nineteenth-century world.

Through engaging with a range of both primary and secondary sources on five selected cities - Hanoi, Saigon, Hue, Dalat, and Vinh - we will explore how cities served as stages for historical changes, how urban populations were both agents and targets of these changes, and how ideas of being urban evolved over time. Our discussions will focus on five main themes: (1) historiographical approaches to studying cities, (2) experiences of modernity, (3) urban classes and marginalized groups, (4) cities and war, and (5) urban change and continuity. These themes will serve as the foundation for students' final projects. This course will be taught by Professor Uyen Nguyen."

This course sets out to look back to the 20th century to examine conditions under which Black women lived in the early days of Jim Crow and the role that Black women and non-binary people have played in shaping politics, grassroots organizing, the legal bar, and higher education during Jim (Jane) Crow and beyond. Through the archive and the personal papers of Pauli Murray, June Jordan, Angela Davis, and Flo Kennedy, we will see the human side of these themes and the Black Freedom Struggle. What did life look like for Black women during the Nadir? How did these people navigate gender and sexuality while pushing for civil rights? How did gender, sexuality, and intersectionality impact their political ideologies?Though many scholars argue that the law is autonomous, Critical Legal Studies scholars and Critical Race theorists argue that the law is subjective. In Race, Gender, and the Law through the Archive, students will see the subjectivity of the Black women and non-binary people who helped push for social and legal reform. Some of these women/people shaped the law as attorneys (Pauli Murray and Flo Kennedy). In contrast, others shaped the law and visions of freedom through their activism (Murray, Kennedy, Angela Y.

Unfolding across Afro-Eurasia, the Medieval Islamic Commercial Revolution wove together a world system of unprecedented reach and strength, as new trade networks extended across land and sea to join the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, North and Sub Saharan Africa, Central and South Asia, reaching all the way to China. As a result of this momentous development, technologies such as paper-making spread from East Asia all the way to Europe; new crops such as sugar, cotton, and citruses started being cultivated across Afro-Eurasia; new global tastes developed, with Chinese porcelain becoming a common product in the Middle East and European elites becoming accustomed to South Asia spices. Yet the social and economic dynamics of this 'globalization before globalization' remain poorly understood. In following the lives and business activities of merchants (Muslim and not) of the Islamic world through the primary sources that they themselves produced (their letters, accounts, books), we will ask how this great feat was achieved.

This course explores the theme of slavery in environmental context through the lenses and methods of public history, a field of historical inquiry and applied knowledge production that stresses past-present connections, community engagement, collaborative work, and audiences beyond the academy. As a foundational element in the structure of U.S. society, slavery has made a lasting imprint on social, cultural, political, economic, and ecological relations. Nevertheless, American public culture has avoided sustained exploration of the broad and complex history of racialized slavery and instead maintains a stance of discomfort, distance, and ambivalence. We will discuss change over time in public representations of slavery while also addressing the tensions of collaboration and audience engagement."

From the birth of the welfare state to the rise of Thatcherism, from post-colonial migration to multicultural Britain, from the Swinging Sixties to punk rock and riots, we will track these radical political, social and cultural changes through novels, poetry, theater, film, pop music, photography, fashion, food and sport. We will explore the way Britain sought to retain its influence in the world, through its involvement in the Cold War, its relations with the Commonwealth, and its continuing 'special relationship' with the United States, even as what being English or British began to change in meaning. As well as reading literary works by John Osborne, Sam Selvon, and Zadie Smith, we will consider the nation's popular culture, from The Beatles to The Sex Pistols.

We will examine work and labor and their intersections with colonialism, imperialism, and slavery from the nineteenth century through today. The course will also ask how working people have represented themselves, and how they have intervened to change their own lives, and, sometimes, the course of history. Our analysis will encompass racialized, feminized, and unfree labor; domestic and reproductive labor; migrant, casual, and emotional labor, as well as the labor of the artist and the organizer. We will engage with a wide range of historical and literary texts from Latin America and the United States to consider how writers from across the Americas have used literature to consider what it feels like to work, and to refuse work. Course readings may include Solomon Northrup's 12 Years a Slave, Gabriel García Márquez's 100 Years of Solitude, and Jamaica Kincaid's Lucy, as well as works from theorists such as Sylvia Federici, CLR James, Karl Marx, Kathi Weeks and Raymond Williams.

We will place a wide range of primary texts, including fiction, poetry, film, television, and visual art, in conversation with larger political and cultural questions about race, gender, citizenship, imperialism and belonging in the U.S. The course will be organized around four major events in Asian American history: the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the subsequent exclusion of Asian immigrants in the decades that followed; the incarceration of Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans during World War II; Cold War Orientalism after WWII; the racial politics of imperial war and Islamophobia in the post-9/11 United States; and the sharp increase in anti-Asian racial violence during the Covid-19 pandemic. We will also consider the historical movements and migrations of people of Asian descent to North America; U.S. wars in Asia; the conflicts of identity, community, and citizenship; the gender and sexual dynamics of Asian American racialization; and the relationship of Asian Americans to other communities of color. In doing so, this course grapples with what it means for Asian America to have been characterized and circumscribed by a multitude of cultural discourses— legal, geopolitical, and textual—throughout dominant as well as subversive narratives of U.S. history.

HIST-LIT 90FK Europe After the Cold War Matthew Sohm Contemporary Europe is a continent of contrasts: it's home to some of the most peaceful, prosperous societies on earth, while continuing to be marred by war, economic stagnation, and division. This course explores how we got to the Europe of today's headlines. We begin by investigating the apparent triumph of Western liberalism in the aftermath of the Cold War—what political scientist Francis Fukuyama dubbed the end of history. How did this supposed victory of Western values confront new realities of economic stagnation, migration, racial conflict, and war? And how did European states seek to preserve equality, economic prosperity, and social welfare at home in an unequal world? Course topics include the fall of Communism and German reunification, neoliberalism and inequality, youth culture, social democracy and the welfare state, the 2008 financial crisis, the 2010s migrant crisis, and the rise of populist politics. We consider texts by Angela Merkel, Lea Ypi, Jenny Erpenbeck, Michel Houellebecq, Joan Scott, Thomas Piketty, Tony Judt, and Timothy Garton Ash; music from the Eurovision song contest; television shows such as NSU German History X; and films like the 1993 French drama La Haine, the 2003 German reunification comedy Good Bye, Lenin!, the 2013 Italian portrait of decadence La Grande Bellezza (The Great Beauty), and the 2016 German comedy Toni Erdmann.

HIST-LIT 90GB American Education Reforms Emily Gowen Education is often understood as a lever for social change, but ideas about what constitutes a good education have long been hotly contested. What is more, the seeds of today's most urgent educational controversies— such as debates about equity, educational purpose, censorship, etc.—can be found in archives related to America's earliest schools. In this course, we will trace various American education reform movements from the early colonial period through the turn of the 20th century, and explore the philosophical, practical, and social conflicts that animated them. We will move thematically and chronologically through the histories of Indian schools, common schools, freedpeople's schools, and women's colleges, and end with post-reconstruction regimes of school segregation. Readings will include essays by thinkers like Horace Mann, Emma Willard, and W.E.B. DuBois, as well as educational materials like the New England Primer, the American Spelling Book, The Brownies' Book, and a range of novels, poems, tracts, and stories spanning the long nineteenth century. Students will have the chance to conduct hands-on research at archives related to various local educational institutions and will be encouraged to explore the legacies of early American reforms in today's educational landscape.

HIST-LIT 90GE Screen Cultures from Cinema to TikTok Emmet von Stackelberg The way we see the world is growing inseparable from the way our screens show that world to us. It would be almost impossible to avoid screens for even a single day. This course follows the 125-year history of screen cultures in the United States—from motion pictures, to television, to personal computers, Gameboys, and, of course, smartphones. How have people engaged with screens, and how have these responses changed along with the technology? How did those in power try to use screens or limit them in response to larger political events and concerns? How have U.S. and transnational screen cultures shaped or troubled racial boundaries and gender binaries? What is the relationship between culture, media, and technology? In this course, students will interact with screens in material form and assume the role of viewer for a range of different screen products: films, animation, television shows, video games, websites, and tiktok videos. Additionally, we will also read newspaper and magazine accounts, fiction, and poetry to explore the cultural reception of screens, while engaging with the work of critics and artists including Stuart Hall, Marlon Riggs, Hito Steyerl and Walter Benjamin.

Du Bois famously wrote that the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line. This course is a survey of the work of intellectuals, artists, and activists in the late-nineteenth and twentieth centuries who took this problem seriously, and who sought to understand its origins, its functions, and how it ought to be addressed. It will expose students to certain foundational ideas, problems, and debates in the study of race and ethnicity in twentieth century America. Readings may include works by C.L.R. James, Zora Neale Hurston, Leslie Marmon Silko, Gloria Anzaldua, James Baldwin, Cedric Robinson, bell hooks, William Faulkner, and Toni Morrison, among others. Most importantly, the course aims to provide students the opportunity to develop their own critical and historical acumen to study those aspects of race and ethnicity that they find most urgent or fascinating.

HIST-LIT 90GT World War II in Image, Text, and Sound Jules Riegel Almost eighty years after the end of World War II, its legacies are alive as ever. The conflict was fought across much of the globe, ravaging landscapes and ecosystems and wiping villages, towns, and even cities from the face of the earth. Estimates of combined civilian and military deaths typically range between 50,000,000 and 85,000,000, an almost unimaginably devastating toll. Yet how does our understanding of World War II change when we return to literature, art, music, and other cultural works of the time?This course examines civilians' and soldiers' everyday experiences of the war through sources such as diaries, photographs, films, songs, and visual art. We will focus on the war in Europe, while considering sources from the war's other theaters, including the U. S. and the Pacific. Topics will include the war's origins; life and death under occupation; the impact of strategic bombing; the propaganda war; documentation of wartime atrocities, especially through photography; the Holocaust; the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; and the pursuit of postwar justice. Throughout the semester, we will employ lenses such as race, gender, and class as we analyze wartime cultural creations, seeking to better understand what it meant to live and die during the most terrible war in human history. HIST-LIT 90GX U.S. Women of Color Feminisms since the 1970s Kiran Lam-Saili The history of U.S. women of color feminist politics and expressive cultures is one filled with Black, Indigenous, Chicana, and Asian American thinkers who have demanded that we take seriously how categories such as race, sex, gender, sexuality, class, and ability shape our world and our relation to it. With attention to the historical and political conditions from which our creative texts arise, this course will take three main, loosely chronological, turns. First, we will examine the emergence and implications of the term women of color in the late 1970s. Second, we will consider key developments in specific women of color feminisms during the 1980s and 1990s, from critiques of settler colonialism in Indigenous and Chicana thought, to challenges to imperialism's afterlives in the Asian American context. Finally, we will turn to the 21st century to engage contemporary women/queer of color thought on issues like media representation, reproductive justice, migrant carework, abolition, and disability justice. Primary sources will include fiction, poetry, visual art, and films, as well as protest performances, interviews, government/intergovernmental documents, political speeches/essays/pamphlets/manifestos, and magazine articles. We will read/watch, for example, fiction by Audre Lorde, mixed-memoir by Gloria Anzaldúa, poetry by Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha and Chrystos, and films like Red Canary Song's Fly in Power.

HIST-LIT 90GZ Magic and Mythology in Latin America and the Caribbean Cristina Garcia Navas This course traces the presence of the supernatural in Latin American literature, art, and culture. How has contact between fantasy, magic, and mythology been central to defining and thinking about the contours of social and historical realities in the region? The seminar focuses on the historical meanings of fantasy, myths, and legends and how they relate to memory and identity. What is the relationship between myths and cultural imaginaries with colonial and post-colonial legacies? How has fiction about supernatural beings shaped notions of gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as national and transnational imaginary communities in the region? These are some of the questions we will explore in this course, which studies the social, ecological, and political meanings of popular myths present in the region's literature and oral tradition. We will analyze stories about Andean Huaca deities, Amazons, duels with the Devil, witches, and other supernatural creatures inhabiting fiction and imaginaries in -and about- Latin America and the Caribbean. Assigned texts may include works by Lydia Cabrera, Jorge Luis Borges, Oswald de Andrade, Juan Rulfo, José Guadalupe Posada, Frida Kahlo, Remedios Varo, Leonora Carrington, Gabriel García Márquez, Julio Cortázar, Elena Garro, José María Arguedas, Aimé Césaire, Gloria Anzaldúa, and Mariana Enríquez.

HIST-LIT 90HA The American West Chloe Hawkey From cowboys to tech bros, images of the American West are everywhere—and they have been for a long time. The data of geological surveys and census reports have never been able to outweigh Americans' (often conflicting) dreams of the West: the land of endless potential or a wasteland, naturally sublime or demanding development. This course explores these ideas, their development, and the interplay between them and political and economic growth. Where do these ideas come from, and how do they change over time? What happens when they clash with social or political reality? What are the benefits and drawbacks of focusing our attention on the realm of culture? As we work to answer these questions, we'll also address the methods of settler colonial theory, environmental history, and literary history. Our discussions will move between ideas about the land, geology, and environmental damage and ideas about people, cities, and technology, as we seek to understand how deeply interrelated these various aspects of the American West are.

HIST-LIT 90HB Indigenous Economies and Environments Mandy Izadi The course surveys histories of economies built by Indigenous Americans on their own lands. It also examines economies—local and global—that settler colonists built from stolen lands and natural resources of Indigenous Americans. Spanning centuries, and extending to the present, this course is organized conceptually into three principal sections on Land, Energy, and Gaming. Moving chronologically from places as varied as wetlands and oilfields to casinos, we will examine subjects relating to land loss, resource extraction, and Indigenous struggles for economic sovereignty. More broadly, we will study intersections of colonialism and capitalism; race-based violence; colonial legal systems; conceptions of hierarchy and harmony in human-nature relationships; cultural and spiritual underpinnings of Indigenous and non-Indigenous economies; environmental justice; human rights and the rights of nature. Special attention will be paid to Indigenous sciences, including traditional ecological knowledge that has sustained life here for millennia for the continent's first peoples and eventually, Euro- Americans. This class prioritizes perspectives, voices, knowledge systems of Indigenous Americans. It draws from the arts, humanities, and sciences. Film and literature—classic, celebrated, problematic—brings depth to our interdisciplinary readings. The academic scholarship we consult draws from Native history; Environmental Sciences; global Capitalism; the Law; Native Studies, and more.

HIST-LIT 90HC Music, Memory, and Identity in Latin America Cristina Garcia Navas This course explores the role music plays in the creation and transmission of memory and identity in Latin American cultures. How have musical traditions shaped the development of collective ethnic and national narratives, as well as conceptions of gender and race? How has music engaged with political movements and power across the region? We begin with colonial sources documenting Indigenous and African voices through chronicles and early song collections. We then move to 19th century revolutionary corridos—popular ballads narrating events from the South American independence movements to the changing North American national borders. Along with examples from oral tradition, we study the reinterpretations of songs by marginalized peasant populations in literary works that helped to mold modern Latin American national identities, such as the Argentine epic poem Martín Fierro and the Colombian novel María. Finally, we turn to the rise of popular 20th- century musical genres, including cumbia, salsa, currulao, and reggaeton, as well as folk and rock artists like Mercedes Sosa and Sui Generis singing against 20th-century dictatorships. While the course will be conducted in English, Spanish language materials will be available for students who wish to fulfill History & Literature's language requirement.

Are new technologies improving our lives or degrading them? This course investigates the history of fears—and hopes—regarding the massive technological ruptures of the 20th century, a period of rapid industrialization and urbanization punctuated by two technologically sophisticated world wars. We'll focus on how technological change has been represented across a range of cultural texts—including films like Fritz Lang's Metropolis, speculative fiction by W.E.B. DuBois and Ursula K. Le Guin, and the Afrofuturistic music of Sun Ra—asking what these representations reveal about the controversies, panics, and celebrations that swirled around technological changes to daily life. How did new machineries of battle change attitudes toward violence and trauma after the first World War? How did industrial mechanization alter the experience of work? And what stood behind Cold War preoccupations with flying saucers, atomic bombs, and the beginnings of the space race? Along the way we will also explore how new technologies of entertainment— including film, radio, and television—were attacked and adored as symbols of modernity themselves, even as they were used to pass judgment on modern science, technology, and medicine.

HIST-LIT 93AA Queer Archives Lauren Kaminsky Queer histories are all around us, but rarely do they announce themselves as such. This research seminar offers training in archival methods with a focus on historical subjects who deviate from dominant historical narratives. In centering queer archival traces, we will read along the grain with dissident voices representing minoritized gender and sexual subjectivities, while also cultivating a practice of reading against the grain as a way of attending to the exclusionary operations of representational practices. This course will be taught in and draw on the Schlesinger Library's extraordinary collections, and much of our class time will be spent exploring materials that can only be accessed on site. This course requires no prior knowledge or experience, and assignments will culminate in an essay based on original archival research. Interested students should petition to enroll on my.harvard.

HIST-LIT 93AG Oral Histories and Archives Andi Remoquillo To understand the archive is to understand history: neither is neutral, homogenous, nor fully representative of any one story. Indeed, many scholars argue that archives aren't repositories for objective truths but rather political and epistemological projects that have the power to suppress certain voices—or liberate them. How can we make sense of the archive in a way that counters historical silences? And how might oral histories fill in gaps left by archival negations? This course introduces students to theories, practices and controversies of the archive and oral history methodologies, with the goal of creating what the scholar Marianne Hirsch calls countermemories, representations of the past that unearth ignored or disruptive material. Readings include interdisciplinary writing by feminist, anti-racist, and anti-colonial scholars demonstrating a range of approaches, as well as primary sources like historical documents and novels that incorporate archival materials to reimagine the past, present, and future. We will also work with Schlesinger Library's archival collections, community-based archives and digitized oral histories, and practice oral history interviews of our own. At semester's end, students will conduct original research on a topic of their choice using archival materials and oral histories collected earlier in the semester.

HIST-LIT 93AH Music, Politics, and Protest in the United States Caitlin Schmid In this course, we'll explore the intersection of music and social movements in the United States in the 20th and 21st centuries. How have musicians, critics, and audiences positioned music as political (and what does that mean)? What does a protest sound like, and what can that tell us about particular modes of resistance tied to race, class, gender, and sexuality? Can music be an effective agent of change? Drawing on a wide variety of sources–texts, archives, recordings, performances, experiential knowledge–we'll ask how music and sound have worked in history to document, dissent, and/or protest; how music functions in our own sociopolitical context; and how music imagines utopian and dystopian futures. The seminar will delve into methods of researching and writing about sound, and students will have the opportunity to conduct original research towards a substantial academic paper and to develop written and creative materials for public audiences.

As both an abstract construct and a material entity, money makes the world go around. Since before the invention of writing, money has been a common facet of everyday life, informing how we think and act. The course explores how societies across human history have made, used, and valued money in divergent ways. We will consider money as an object of aesthetic appreciation, an ethical problem, an architect of social relations, an environmental disruptor, a tool of political resistance, and much more. How has coinage design functioned as a political, religious, and cultural symbol? Is money a measure of value, and how does it align with other potential values, such as religious, moral, and aesthetic ones? Is it ethically neutral or an instrument of moral vice or virtue? What were the debates surrounding the rise of paper money? How has money been used as a tool of revolutionary movements and political resistance? Does money get recycled, and what is the environmental cost of different money forms today? What are the links between art, literature, theater, cinema, and money?

Thesis students will be responsible for selecting a Thesis Advisor (or Advisors) with whom they will meet regularly to develop specific intention, substance and methodology of the thesis research and paper. This seminar is a support of independent thesis and/or independent project research, extending methodological inquiry of the project topic to design where students may convene to collectively discuss and experiment with design speculations – design tests that explore research through the visual and spatial language of architecture. The course will cover topics general to design research with discussions, assignments, and readings focused on three main themes in relation to architectural design: Discourse, the development of a proposition for the role and significance of architecture relative to the project topic of interest; Method, the design steps/process of working through a design application/inquiry of those ideas; and Context, the relationship of the project topic of study to broader surroundings which include but are not limited to the discipline of architecture, cultural contexts, technical developments and/or typologies. The seminar will emphasize and support the translation of ideas emerging from independent research into visual forms of representation including, but not limited to, drawings, diagrams, images, study models, and shortanimations.

Design, the bringing together of these elements, requires sensitivity, registers scale, and renders perceptual effect. This course is an introductory architectural design studio focused on building foundational architectural concepts and design methodologies studied through a process of making. A series of physical modeling/fabrication assignments explore spatial and organizational transformations as a consequence of the changing interactions among material, fabrication technique, and form. Resultant expressions of space, scale, and perceptual effects are discussed and evaluated in relation to a series of course readings that frame the intentions of each assignment within architectural theory and history discourse. Both studios in the Architecture Studies Track (Transformations HAA 96A and Connections HAA 96B) explore architectural means and methods of design. Each begins from a different scale of inquiry, but converges at a similar end. This studio originates at the scale of material - focusing on specific capacities and effects thereof as well as the details of assembly - and expands from this to an investigation of an occupiable architectural scale in relation to a dynamic site. The course emphasizes fluency in the visual and spatial communication of ideas through instruction in 2D drawing and 3D modeling techniques. Technical workshops are provided in choreography with serial assignments encompassing drafting and 3D modeling (AutoCAD + Rhino), techniques of fabrication (Rhino to various outputs), 3D printing, and representational processing (Adobe Creative Suite).

This studio takes on the challenge through a series of design exercises focused on understanding, engaging with, and reimaging the urban condition. Throughout the course, we will approach architectural design as both a method of producing urban environments, and also as an avenue through which to understand our cities. We will be directly confronting the social, political, and environmental contexts that are necessarily implicated in any design process.Both studios in the Architecture Studies Track (Transformations HAA 96A and Connections HAA 96B) explore architectural means and methods of design.

Nearly fifty percent of these emissions are attributed directly to building construction. And these numbers are predicted to grow, more than doubling the gross amount of material extraction and flow around the planet by 2060. This course asks how we design new architectures that fit within the circuits, circles, and loops of a healthy, regenerative material ecology.Through in-class lectures, case studies, and hands-on workshops, students will develop a comprehensive understanding of both contemporary theory and practical applications surrounding lifecycle material design. They will actively research topics such as systems ecology, extractive geographies, life cycle material modeling, circular design, pervasive connectivity, biomaterials, adaptive reuse, indigenous and traditional craftsmanship, healthy materials, social equity, and other pertinent subjects. Additionally, students will acquire advanced proficiency in utilizing software tools and innovate new fabrication processes to address material flows around and through buildings effectively.Beyond theoretical knowledge, this course offers a unique opportunity for students to actively confront the environmental and human impacts associated with material management in the built environment. Through hands-on, design-led learning experiences, students will be encouraged to tackle these challenges by designing and building real-world prototypes through semester-long team projects that utilize industry and Harvard University material resources. Ultimately, students will develop a robust research framework to investigate, deconstruct, and invent new material life cycle design strategies that critically engage pluralistic design solutions toward a new regenerative architecture."

What skills of visual literacy and critical consciousness are required to understand of the opportunities and challenges that technology is presenting to civic life? This seminar—primarily for graduates and open to undergraduates as well—will explore the connection between images and justice in America. What constitutes a figurative emblem of protest? What does effective resistance look like in art and in the digital realm?

Prompted by the Harvard Art Museums' recent accession of over one hundred works by Gustavs Klucis and Valentina Kulagina-- leading Soviet photomonteurs of the 1920s and 1930s--and the Houghton Library's growing collection of photomontaged books and magazines, this seminar offers an episodic history of the medium from the 19th- century to the advent of the digital age. Through first-hand examination of individual works, we study the medium's use in not only the fine arts, but also agitational political posters and postcards distributed en masse, protest flyers, magazines and albums, and monumental displays at exhibitions and trade fairs. Of particular interest is the recourse to photomontage for the expression of political dissent (Berlin Dada) and the affirmative representation of public assemblies and collectivities (Soviet avant-garde). In addition to Klucis and Kulagina, other photomonteurs to be discussed include Hannah Höch, John Heartfield, Marianne Brandt, El Lissitzky, Romare Bearden, and Martha Rosler. A darkroom session will introduce students to analogue processes, while a field trip will enable us to visit New York museums and meet with one of the world's most important collectors of photomontage.

McCormick This graduate course surveys the history and development of the folding-screen format in Japanese painting from the 8th to the 20th centuries. Through a series of case studies, the course explores art historical issues for which the folding screen provides a unique perspective, including the relationships between painting and architectural space, poetic practice, and religious ritual. Functioning simultaneously as furniture and pictorial surface, spatial divide and architectural decor, the folding screen has played an important role in shaping culture and lived experience in the Japanese archipelago for over a millennium. Transportable and displayable in a variety of ways, the folding screen can surround a space and immediately charge it with meaning. Some of the most historically significant Japanese paintings were executed in this format, and its influence around the world can be seen in everything from the painted panels of James McNeil Whistler to the biombo of colonial Latin America. This graduate lecture surveys the history and development of the Japanese folding screen from the 8th to the 20th centuries. Each week will focus on one case study from the screen painting tradition to highlight a historical theme and methodological problem closely linked to the unique properties of this format. These themes offer a range of issues crucial to the reconceptualization of Japanese painting history as a whole: 1) The function of screens in different social spaces (the Nara Imperial Palace, the Heian aristocratic compound, the Buddhist temple hall, the Ashikaga shogunal residence; or the modern reception room); 2) the various text-image relationships embodied by different types of screens (including both the relationship of painting to poetic practice and the pictorialization of narrative texts); 3) the role of screens in religious ritual, including the Esoteric initiation (abisekha) ceremony and mortuary practice; 4) compositional strategies reflected in the adaptations of painting subjects in other formats to the folding-screen surface; 5) the function of screens as representations of different types of topoi, charged with a panoply of political and cultural meanings; and 6) the interpretation of depictions of screens within other paintings."

Instead, we see increasing interest in phenomena that even a decade ago would have been beyond the pale, from psychedelics to near- death experiences, to deathbed visioning, to lucid dreaming. The spaces in which consciousness research happens has also expanded: no longer just the neuroscience lab, but the hospice, the meditation retreat, the ICU, the operating theater, the wildlife preserve, and AI research labs.

This seminar seeks to answer this question by exploring three distinct registers in which the concept of the planetary has been gestated in 20th century collective life.Readings will be divided into three analytic parts. Part I will deal with drones as a technoscientific entity in late modernity that is responsible not merely for the militarization of the air but also a concomitant production of airspace as planetary battlescape and an agent for the geo-mapping of diverse biological entities. Part II will provide historical genealogies of One/Planetary health discourse concerning the flow of pathogenic life over earthly space. Such discourse, we will examine, as the symptomatology of the fictions of national borders. Part III will delve deeper into 20th century and Cold War environmental imaginaries which have produced the planet/globe/earth as slippery signifiers of imperiled spatial life in late modernity.

House Seminars Eliot House Seminar HSEMR-EL 80 Photography and Time David Elmer Since their invention in the 19th century, photographic processes have offered the illusion of the ability to capture an instantaneous moment in time. Even the shortest photographic exposure, however, captures something longer than an instant—a more or less lengthy duration—so that, in spite of its stillness, every photograph is also a record of change over time. And in more obvious ways, as representations of temporally distant people, places, and events, photography stands in a fascinating and complex relation to time. We will explore this relation through a combination of reading, discussion, analysis of photographs and films, and, above all, through the creation of original photographs.The practical component of the seminar will introduce students to the fundamentals of both digital and film photography, but with an emphasis on film and darkroom techniques. Darkroom work will be conducted in the Eliot House Darkroom. As the course will be fundamentally bound to the physical spaces of Eliot House, students will collaborate in a creative photographic project documenting the spaces and collective life of Eliot House in the last year before the house undergoes renewal. In addition to conventional cameras, we will explore a variety of alternative ways of making photographs, including solargraphy (long-term exposures documenting the sun's path over weeks or months), home-made pinhole cameras, cyanotype printing, and the use of photographic emulsions on materials other than paper. We will even explore the possibility of turning Eliot House itself into a large-format camera (by constructing a temporary camera obscura in the gateway that looks out onto Memorial Drive and JFK St.). collaborate in the creation of a body of collective artwork for the Eliot House community. After an initial exhibition in Spring 2025, this artwork will be displayed in Eliot's swing housing from Fall 2025 through Spring 2027, and from Fall 2027 on will be permanently installed in the renovated spaces of Eliot House, where it will serve as a reminder of the continuity of the Eliot House community through change and across time.

We now know that some of the first Homo sapiens appeared over 315,000 years ago. Looking back to even earlier human species, around 2-3 million years ago, we would perhaps be surprised to encounter familiar behaviors: people walking upright, cooperating and socializing, hunting, and using technology. Everything that exists as written history represents less than 2% of what has happened since we emerged as a species, and less than 0.3% of what has happened since archaic humans first emerged. If we want to understand who we are, and why we do the things we do, we need to take a closer look at our relatives in the Paleolithic. Technology, Behavior, and Human Evolution is an introductory course which offers primatological, fossil, environmental, genetic, and archaeological perspectives on human evolution. Starting with the earliest hominins, each week we will examine central themes and developments in human evolution over the last 6 million years. Students will consider how the emergence and spread of new technologies, biological capacities, changing social dynamics, symbolic behaviors, and cultural complexity shaped human evolutionary trajectories.

In addition, different human groups or ethnicities vary markedly in the burden of these conditions. In this course we will explore two related ideas to gain insight into these issues. The first is that many modern ailments reflect an imbalance between modern life ways and those which shaped our ancestors' biology during much of human evolution. The second is that factors like inequality and discrimination, which trace to political, economic, and historical forces, help explain why some groups experience unequal conditions that ultimately drive health inequality. We will begin by reviewing foundational concepts in evolutionary biology, molecular biology, anthropology and human evolution, revealing why our bodies by necessity come equipped with biology that is responsive to the environments that we inhabit. We will then use these principles to explore domestic and global case studies that illustrate the power of evolutionary principles to shed light on why we get sick, including the role of social, economic and political factors as drivers of major disparities in disease burden."

The size and shape of the face has changed dramatically across human evolution. Some of our prehistoric relatives had huge teeth and enormous cheek bones, others had massive brow ridges, and modern humans have unique features such as our chins and our unusually big, globular brains. This course will explore how our social interactions and facial expressions, changes in what we eat and how we eat it, and evolutionary adaptations (sexual selection and cultural/environment influences) have molded the face and led to the variety of facial forms we see within and between populations today. We will examine the origins of human facial variation from our early primate origins, across the hominin fossil record, to the impact of modern soft diets and dentistry. What do we think the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees looked like? What were the earliest changes to the face and what can they tell us about the lives of our ancestors? What can our own faces tell us about our ancestry, development, and health?"

Unlike other species, we are heavily reliant on learning from others to acquire many important aspects of our behavior, and this capacity for cultural transmission has given rise to a second system of inheritance that not only explains much of our contemporary behavior but has driven our species' genetic evolution over hundreds of thousands or even millions of years. Humans are products of culture-gene coevolution. In addition to having shaped our species' anatomy and physiology, cultural evolution has important implications for understanding human nature, and for tackling basic problems and questions in psychology, economics and anthropology. In this class, we will focus on the origins and evolution of human culture using evidence from archaeology, human evolutionary biology, physical anthropology, and related fields. We will investigate how our hominin ancestors acquired and passed down a wealth of accumulated knowledge, such as technologies for hunting and collecting foodstuffs, the medicinal uses of plants, the control and manipulation of fire, and how to identify a distant group member. How did the accumulation of such information change over time and within different hominin groups (such as Neanderthals)?

What does it mean to know the meaning of a sentence? How do different parts of a sentence compose to form a sentence meaning? We will start by looking at sentence-level meanings and relations between them. Then, we will investigate how the meanings of sentence-internal elements (like verbs, subjects, and adjectives) are composed to form sentence meanings. During the process, we will cover some formal tools that allow us to talk about language in a precise way: set theory, propositional logic, predicate logic, and lambda notation. We will consider how the formal tools apply (and not apply) to natural languages and discuss how we can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of meaning."

Uncontrolled inflammation and/or defective resolution mechanisms lead to many diseases, including asthma, fibrosis, cancer, autoimmunity, neurodegeneration and cardiovascular diseases. This course will cover multicellular interaction networks that involve immune, vascular and parenchymal cells, lipid mediators, signaling pathways and organ system-specific mechanisms. Discrete lipid mediator networks, namely, eicosanoids, SPMs, S1P, and LPA that are therapeutically employed to treat diseases will be highlighted. In addition, development of novel therapeutics to control inflammatory and resolution pathology will be discussed. The course will have an hour of didactic lectures given by expert faculty. The second hour will feature a student- led discussion of a recent journal article in the area of the lecture. Students will also have an opportunity for synthesizing the lecture and/or the journal club in a social media format (i.e. Tweetorial, You Tube video, minipodcast) for the purpose of communication/ dissemination of scientific information. provided by the course faculty."

Specific topics include a molecular dissection of the signaling pathways, gene regulatory networks, and epigenetic mechanisms that control primary axis formation and regional specification, establishment of cell fate, homeotic genes and patterning, cell migration and cell-cell signaling, organoid models of nervous system development and their application, axon development and regeneration, neuromuscular development and mechanistic insights for human birth defects, skeletal muscle stem cells in aging and disease, morphogenesis of branched tubular systems, vasculogenesis, biomechanical regulation of developmental processes, skeletal patterning and development, stem cell maintenance in various renewing tissues, germ cells and pluripotency, and directed differentiation of ES and iPS cells for regeneration and disease modeling. We will discuss how state of the art technologies in iPS organoids, cell lineage labeling, genetic manipulation, and genome wide epigenomic/transcriptomic analyses can be employed to study organ development, stem cells and regeneration. Students employ the knowledge gained by lectures and conference sessions to identify interesting new research goals in either vertebrate development, stem cell, or regenerative biology and present research proposals to achieve these goals. Thus, the goals of this course are for students to both learn about the molecular tool-kit that evolution has endowed to vertebrates (and other multicellular animals) AND to learn how to synthesize the literature to come up with their own novel research ideas, and develop a strategy to investigate their hypotheses. sessions in which original literature is discussed in depth.

In addition, the theory and research evidence accumulating in the disciplines of cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and from STEM classrooms, has turned the question of How do we best teach science and medicine? into its own scientific discipline. The Theory and Science of Teaching focuses on understanding why certain teaching methods are effective by examining the scientific research and theoretical frameworks that support these methods. We will read and discuss foundational educational and cognitive psychology texts and primary literature, and then develop course materials that allow us to put these ideas into practice. course is a prerequisite of the other. Class will meet for 2 hours of synchronous discussion and learning activities each week. The remote section will meet Wednesdays from 8:00-10:00 am over Zoom and is reserved for master's students. The in-person section will meet Wednesdays from 2:00-4:00 pm in Longwood and is intended for PhD students who must take their classes in-person. The content of the sections will be the same and both will share identical asynchronous learning components. This will include watching videos, reading a variety of materials, participating in discussion boards, creating sample materials, and writing learning reflections. The synchronous and asynchronous components combine to meet the course objectives and are equally important to students' learning.Class begins September 3rd with the release of the first asynchronous module, which students will complete and discuss in short, individually scheduled small group meetings with the course instructor during the week of Sept. 8, in place of a synchronous class session that week. The first synchronous class meeting is September 17. The course concludes with the final synchronous class session on November 12 and the final capstone assignment due November 19. Make It Stick, by Brown, Roediger and McDaniel is required pre-reading and should be completed before the first day of class on September 17.

Specific topics include a molecular dissection of the signaling pathways, gene regulatory networks, and epigenetic mechanisms that control primary axis formation and regional specification, establishment of cell fate, homeotic genes and patterning, cell migration and cell-cell signaling, organoid models of nervous system development and their application, axon development and regeneration, neuromuscular development and mechanistic insights for human birth defects, skeletal muscle stem cells in aging and disease, morphogenesis of branched tubular systems, vasculogenesis, biomechanical regulation of developmental processes, skeletal patterning and development, stem cell maintenance in various renewing tissues, germ cells and pluripotency, and directed differentiation of ES and iPS cells for regeneration and disease modeling. We will discuss how state of the art technologies in iPS organoids, cell lineage labeling, genetic manipulation, and genome wide epigenomic/transcriptomic analyses can be employed to study organ development, stem cells and regeneration. Students employ the knowledge gained by lectures and conference sessions to identify interesting new research goals in either vertebrate development, stem cell, or regenerative biology and present research proposals to achieve these goals. Thus, the goals of this course are for students to both learn about the molecular tool-kit that evolution has endowed to vertebrates (and other multicellular animals) AND to learn how to synthesize the literature to come up with their own novel research ideas, and develop a strategy to investigate their hypotheses. sessions in which original literature is discussed in depth. A short research proposal is required in lieu of exams. Introductory graduate-level courses in both Cell and Molecular Biology."

Our training in literature analysis is comprised of two related components: (1) eight weekly seminar-style, small group paper discussions with pairs of Harvard faculty instructors that will focus on understanding, dissecting, and evaluating a dozen seminal research papers; and (2) parallel weekly sections led by teaching fellows that focus on the process of peer review and revision of two different scientific manuscripts. In separate sessions, you will engage groups of professional journal editors or faculty members in panel discussions to explore the process of peer review and publishing from different perspectives. Then, toward the end of the course, you will plan and outline your own study design for a current or future project (e.g. current or future rotation), thus applying many of the elements that you have considered in the various section discussions. Finally, you will hold one-on-one conferences to with your teaching fellows to discuss reflections on your goals and strategy for the year ahead. BBS students."

In the past several decades, exciting new discoveries on the neurobiology of sleep have been facilitated by technologies such as functional neuroimaging and molecular genetics. Nonetheless, sleep remains mysterious and controversial and, remarkably, there still is no generally agreed upon function for this behavioral state that occupies one third of our lives! Sleep science exemplifies the translational approach in biomedical science whereby human and animal research together continually advance the field of sleep medicine. In this seminar, lectures during the first half of each class will provide overviews of the physiology and behavioral neuroscience of sleep.The second half of each class will be devoted to student-led discussions of assigned study questions as well as free discussions. In a short term paper, students will research in depth a topic of their choice that they find particularly interesting related to sleep neuroscience or mental health.Students will also briefly present what they have learned about their topic during the final class meetings. Some topics students might choose are described in the following paragraph. In addition, students will keep a nightly sleep and/or dream diary for 2-3weeks at some point during the semester in order to learn more about sleep from their own experiences.They will then describe what they have observed in a short essay.In the past, students have found this exercise to be especially interesting. Lastly, there will be a short open-book, unlimited-time final exam on material from the lectures.Topics for term papers might include the characteristic abnormalities of sleep in mood, anxiety, psychotic, addictive or neurodevelopmental disorders. Scientific findings increasingly point to the importance of sleep for mental health and optimum performance, as well as to sleep disruption as both a result and a contributing cause of mental illnesses. Thus,one might focus on the contribution of primary sleep disorders to psychiatric and neurological illness,such as the circadian rhythm disorders in bipolar illness or insomnia as a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders. Still other topics might focus on the contribution of normal sleep to emotional regulation, memory consolidation, and cognitive performance. For those with more cellular neuroscience interests, topics might focus on linkages between sleep and immunity or the role of sleep in disposal of abnormal proteinsas it relates to neurodegenerative diseases.

Connectomics research, which aims to understand how the brain is wired together into this map, has shown the human brain to be a complex network with the same properties that other complex networks exhibit. Much like our social networks, the world wide web, and our travel systems, the brain demonstrates organization along similar principles as these networks and can be studied using techniques adapted from network science. Using this network neuroscience approach has shown that the brain's gray matter is organized into a functional connectome comprised of modules called brain networks that orchestrate their functions to support our everyday activities. More recently, advances in another MRI technique called diffusion MRI have made it possible to study the organization of the brain's white matter information highways, or structural connectome, that transmit information from brain region-to-brain region, brain network-to-brain network. MRI-based connectomics is a rapidly growing field, with new methods and applications evolving at an incredibly fast pace and there are now numerous large-scale neuroimaging initiatives across the world that are aimed at mapping the human brain connectome. These studies aim to map the human brain connectome across the lifespan, from in utero to the oldest old, and in brain disorders such as mental illnesses, developmental disorders, neurological disorders and other health conditions. The goal of this class is to understand how MRI can be used to study the living human brain connectome and the latest advances these approaches have revealed in our understanding of the wiring of the brain. We will also dive into some of the large-scale neuroimaging datasets to see how we can leverage these open access resources for connectomics research. This course is designed for students in the MBB programs who are interested in learning about how we study brain connectivity and how the brain is organized, including those who are interested in neuroscience applications and brain disorders and those interested in bioinformatics/computer science/statistics/physics applications in neuroimaging. To unlock the black box nature of the sophisticated MRI methods used for connectomics research, we will learn the basics of the workhorse MRI connectomics methods, functional and diffusion MRI, from a conceptual perspective. We will learn how each of these techniques is used for connectomics studies and some key methodological and interpretational issues for each. Then we will focus on the brain's connectome. We will discuss brain organization, including how to construct a brain graph as the mathematical embodiment of the brain's connectome and how to evaluate the brain's network properties using graph theory and other approaches, the brain networks that have been reported in the literature, and the links between structural and functional connectomes. We will do a survey of widely used open access tools for connectivity and connectome analyses, and open access connectome datasets with sample sizes of hundreds up to a hundred thousand, including the Human Connectome Lifespan and Disease Connectome studies, the ABCD study, and the UK Biobank. These datasets will also be used as hypothetical data sources for your final research projects. Last, we will discuss ethical, computational, and statistical issues when working with these large open access datasets.

In 1494 the two kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, Spain and Portugal, signed the Treaty of Tordesillas, which divided the New World between them with the eventual blessing of the Pope Julius II's bull E aquae pro bono pacis. These events paved the way to the continuous presence of the Spanish and Portuguese empires as colonial powers in the Americas until 1898, when Spain lost its last two colonies in the continent, Cuba and Puerto Rico. This course explores the dynamics of coloniality in Latin America through the lens of musical and aural practices that, regulated by a variety of imperial, religious, and civic institutions, played a significant role in shaping the ideologies that have affected everyday class, racial, and gender relations in the region for centuries. The class studies the uses of Catholic music (cathedral and convent), secular music (villancicos and theatrical forms), and folk music (son traditions, fandangos, and Afro Latin American traditions) and their intersections in the implementation and negotiation of colonial class and racial structures and everyday practices, as well as in the development of new transgressive hybrid forms and spaces. These were transcultural forms that allowed members of subaltern racial and ethnic groups to forge cultural spaces of resistance and collective expression within the highly hierarchical order of the colonial Spanish viceroyalties and the Portuguese captaincies of Brazil."

Enrolled attendees learn skills directly applicable to their scholarly work as artist-scholars. Part of this is reflecting on how musicians practice writing and how we may turn our own, or our colleagues, artistic practices into academic books, or other kinds of written texts to share our theorizing with the public. Attendees read a book of their choice as a way to study the art of book writing. Subsequently, they develop the skills to write a book proposal of their own. To foster peer feedback and working within a community of thinkers and artists, the seminar hosts a series of guests with whom attendees enter into conversations. Attendees will moderate discussions, serve as respondents, and engage in open discussions with some of the leading scholars and artists of the topic for the semester. Some of the questions that we engage are: What unique ways of thinking our world might music afford? How do praxis and theory intertwine and influence each other? What kinds of methodologies and new approaches to study, research, and interdisciplinarity might listening, sound, and musicians and their work propose? Our study is aided by reading the writing of musicians who theorized the world as part of their artistic practice and of scholars whose works derive from thinking alongside these practices. Specifically, we will read musicians' texts such as Anthony Braxtion's Tri-Axium Writings, Alice Coltrane's books, Cecil Taylor's liner notes to Unit Structures, and Susie Ibarra's Rhythms of Nature. Alongside those we also engage scholars who develop their theorizing from these musical practices such as Fred Moten and Fumi Okiji. This course is for graduate students of all disciplines. Artists are welcome but skill in music or other artistic disciplines is not required. Nonetheless, the course centers particularly music and sound in their relation to scholarship."

We look at assertions and arguments that music is able to do things: inspire political change (for example, lead to climate activism), model ethical behavior (represent cooperation), reflect social and historical constructs (trace disenchantment), shape an emotional habitus (induce serenity); and claims that music constitutes a kind of thinking that improves on more humdrum and/or dubious ways of knowing. These have been central questions explored by music philosophers, and their responses range from skepticism to passionate hyperbole. What is the motivation for these claims, and why is their fervor often in inverse proportion to the economic value ascribed to music by society? Our entry into the subject is both via several famous philosophers and via contemporary reappraisals in a recent publication, The Oxford Handbook of Western Music and Philosophy."

Another topic is how to evaluate the flood of information about new music currently available and ask how current trends alter existing historiographies. I believe that not only composers, but also musicologists, ethnomusicologists, and theorists should occupy themselves with new music as a significant cultural phenomenon. Writing about new music is not peripheral, but helps establish a discourse within which this repertory can become more visible in the cultural landscape.

This course explores the range of answers to such questions by surveying the rise and fall of several major Bronze and Iron Age empires of ancient southwest Asia, including New Kingdom Egypt, the Hittites, Assyria, Babylon, Achaemenid Persia, and the arrival of Hellenism under Alexander of Macedon. In concert with investigating the structure, ideologies, and characteristics of expansion of these imperial powers, the archaeological, visual, and epigraphic record will be engaged to give equal focus to the diverse experiences of peoples subjected to such structures of domination.

It was originally used to write the Sumerian language, a language that continued to be written for over 3 millennia and produced a corpus of well over 100,000 preserved texts. The act of writing—a means of externalizing and visually representing language—has an inherent materiality to it, one that was new and innovative in the ancient world. In this class, we will explore the relationship between the Sumerian language and the materiality of its writing. Topics will include:How did the cuneiform script develop from visual depictions of material objects to abstract, polysemous signs? How were clay tablets made? How were they prepared for writing? What was the process of inscribing Sumerian on other materials? How did formatting of the tablet develop to provide additional information beyond the text itself? How was text used in conjunction with other types of visual representation (e. g., maps, sketches, floor plans)?What roles did Sumerian inscriptions play on monumental works of art? What do self-referential inscriptions tell us about the objects on which they were inscribed?What functions could Sumerian writing serve beyond conveying linguistic content?A second major component of the course will focus on the materiality of texts as objects preserved in a museum collection.

Case studies focused on various groups of Sumerian texts will serve as the basis for discussion of many different aspects of Mesopotamian religious life.The civilization of Sumer is the oldest civilization in recorded history; the first texts known to humankind were written in Sumer over 5,000 years ago. From the start of writing, and continuing over next three millennia, Sumerian texts offer a multifaceted wealth of insight into religious practices and beliefs of the ancient world. From these texts, we learn about ancient conceptions of creation, the universe, and humanity; myths about gods, goddesses, and demons; the performance of rituals and cultic rites; the construction and provisioning of cult statues; the day-to-day functioning of ancient temples; and much more. Elements of Sumerian religion can be traced through subsequent and surrounding cultures and traditions, both in Assyria and Babylonia, and further afield in the Hittite, Israelite, and Greco-Roman worlds. The study of ancient religions is not only integral to understanding these societies and civilizations to which they belonged, but it also serves as an invaluable point of reference for reflecting on modern-day religions and worldviews.Sumerian texts will serve as the basis for exploring all the topics mentioned above. Primary texts will be provided in transliteration and translation; students will read the texts in translation while making frequent reference to the original Sumerian. Prior knowledge of the language is not required. Classical Hebrew CLAS-HEB AA Elementary Classical Hebrew I Vladimir Olivero This course offers a thorough and rigorous introduction to Classical Hebrew grammar. In this first semester, students will learn the Hebrew script and the basics of Hebrew morphology. This will allow students to begin reading and translating biblical prose in the second semester. By the end of the year, students who have taken both semesters will have covered all the basics of nominal and verbal morphology and will know the foundations of Classical Hebrew syntax. Daily preparation and active class participation mandatory. Course to be taught by Dr. Vladimir Olivero. CLAS-HEB AB Elementary Classical Hebrew II Vladimir Olivero Continuation of Classical Hebrew AA. A thorough and rigorous introduction to Biblical Hebrew, with emphasis on grammar in the first term, and translation of biblical prose in the second. Daily preparation and active class participation mandatory. CLAS-HEB 120A Intermediate Classical Hebrew I Vladimir Olivero The goal of this course is to help students develop fluency and confidence in reading texts from the Hebrew Bible in Hebrew. To this end, the bulk of the course will consist of close readings of select narrative passages from the Bible, with a focus on understanding and analyzing their vocabulary, morphology, and syntax. Students will also systematically review the most common vocabulary found in the Hebrew Bible as a whole as well as the grammar covered in first-year Hebrew, besides being introduced to more advanced aspects of syntax and to a more nuanced approach to the Masoretic text. Prerequisite: Introductory Classical Hebrew I and II (CLAS-HEB AA+AB = HDS 4010 A+B) or the equivalent. Daily preparation and active class participation mandatory. Course to be taught by Dr. Vladimir Olivero. Classical Hebrew AA/AB sequence or equivalent. CLAS-HEB 120B Intermediate Classical Hebrew II Vladimir Olivero This course is centered on the close reading of select poetic texts from Isaiah, Proverbs, and Psalms in Hebrew, with a focus on deepening one's knowledge of morphology and syntax, broadening one's vocabulary base, and understanding how Hebrew poetry works. Classical Hebrew 120a or equivalent. CLAS-HEB 130AR Rapid Reading Classical Hebrew I: Pentateuch Vladimir Olivero This course is designed to help students increase their reading fluency with Classical Hebrew (in the Tiberian tradition), deepen their knowledge of Hebrew morphosyntax, and expand their Hebrew vocabulary by covering large areas of biblical Hebrew narrative from the Pentateuch (selections from Genesis through Deuteronomy). In the process, students will be exposed to Hebrew prose materials that are key to understanding the history of ancient Israel and Judah and the formation of the Hebrew Bible. Prerequisites: Classical Hebrew AA/AB sequence, CH 120a, and 120b, or equivalent to two years of academic study of Classical Hebrew. Classical Hebrew AA/AB sequence, CH 120a, and 120b, or equivalent. CLAS-HEB 130BR Rapid Reading Classical Hebrew II Vladimir Olivero This course is designed to help students increase reading fluency and speed in Classical Hebrew poetry. To this end, the course will consist of a close reading of the Book of the Twelve (Hosea–Malachi), paying particular attention to the areas of phonology, morphology, and syntax. Given its internal linguistic diversity, the Book of the Twelve offers the unique advantage of exposing students to the diachronic (e.g., Standard vs. Late Biblical Hebrew) and stylistic dimensions of Biblical Hebrew. Depending on individual student interests, the course will also provide opportunities to explore historical linguistics, compositional poetics, textual criticism, and the Tiberian reading tradition. Prerequisites: Classical Hebrew AA/AB sequence, CH 120a, and 120b, or equivalent. Classical Hebrew 130a or equivalent. Offered jointly with the Divinity School as 1626. CLAS-HEB 138 What is Biblical Hebrew? Vladimir Olivero Biblical Hebrew is taught and often studied as a monolithic entity, despite the widespread recognition that behind this label lies a more complex reality. The goal of this course is twofold: first, to familiarize the students with the variety of attested reading traditions and, second, to introduce them to the periodization of Biblical Hebrew. In each case we will read portions of texts to better grasp the main linguistic differences between reading traditions and between chronolects, and to understand the interpretative implications of such differences. We will begin with a detailed and advanced study of the Tiberian reading tradition, whose basic features the students already know. We will then explore the less known, yet prestigious, Babylonian reading tradition, which we will compare to the more familiar Tiberian one. Finally, the students will be introduced to the so-called popular reading traditions, that is the Palestinian reading tradition and the transliterations of portions of texts and words of the Hebrew Bible into Greek (e.g., Origen's Secunda and those found in the Septuagint) and into Latin (e.g., Jerome). To conclude our study of reading traditions, we will study the Samaritan reading tradition and read portions of the Samaritan Pentateuch. With regards to periodization and linguistic diachrony, the students will be introduced to the distinctive features (mostly syntactic and semantic) of the three main chronolects of Biblical Hebrew and their respective textual corpora: Classical Biblical Hebrew (pre-exilic); Transitional Biblical Hebrew (exilic); Late Biblical Hebrew (post-exilic). Epigraphic Hebrew and textual criticism will help illustrate how chronolects can be further assessed. Classical Hebrew Akkadian"

But what is science? How did it arise? What are its foundations and implications? In this introductory-level course, students will explore key philosophical ideas such as empiricism, evidence, induction, naturalism, realism, and explanation, as well as the relationships between science, philosophy, and society. They will emerge with a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the nature of modern science and be positioned to form considered views concerning its presuppositions, commitments, and consequences."

Philosophers spend a lot of time thinking about the structure of thought, language, and reasons. They have, at least in the western tradition, paid less attention to the more visceral and emotional aspects of human experience. In this course, we'll use some of the tools developed in philosophy to examine questions central to most of our lives: what makes a relationship a friendship?; what do we owe our friends, and how can we be good friends?; what is love, and why is it such an important feature of human life?; when is love bad, and when is it good?; what is sex?; when is sex wrong, and when is it good?; can friends be lovers?"

Should a person focus on achieving immortality or on living a simple, happy mortal life? Is morality simply a matter of convention? Why be moral when being immoral could provide access to more wealth, fame, and power? What is the relationship between etiquette and morality? What do people owe a society that has failed in its obligations to its people? How can we identify and resist oppression, marginalization, and injustice? Human beings all over the world have been thinking about, discussing, and debating questions like these for thousands of years. This course aims to look at this history of ethics and moral philosophy from a genuinely inclusive perspective by focusing on ethical thought both from all over the world, with special emphasis on that of members of traditionally marginalized groups and from areas of the world that typically receive much less attention in academic philosophy and ethics."

This course focuses on some of these ethical debates between Confucian, Mohist, Daoist, and Legalist philosophers in early China. We'll read both classical texts such as the Analects of Confucius, Mengzi, Xunzi, Mozi, and Zhuangzi and important contemporary scholarship on these texts. Several moral questions will be of particular importance: What is the relationship between etiquette and morality? What are the most important virtues to acquire? Should we think of morality and moral development as something natural or artificial? Are we justified in caring more about some people (our closest friends and family) than others? We will have a special focus on three important interpretive themes for the course: (1) How can understanding the particular contours of the debates each scholar is engaged in help us understand their overall views? (2) How does each philosopher's view of human psychology and epistemology constrain, guide, and support their moral theorizing? (3) How can an understanding of early Chinese ethical thought, theory, and debate help enrich contemporary discussions in ethics and moral philosophy? No previous experience or coursework in Chinese philosophy is required for this course."

Nevertheless, it's hard to deny that we live in a world shaped by Cartesian dualism: we distinguish somatic health from mental health; we dissociate our minds from our bodies on a long run; we try to get the mind back into the body through yoga. After looking at the two sides of Cartesian dualism, Cartesian body and Cartesian mind, we will consider some of the notorious metaphysical problems it gives rise to and six 17th- century attempts to push back against it in the figures of Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, the Cambridge Platonists Henry More and Ralph Cudworth, Margaret Cavendish, Anne Conway, and Anton Wilhelm Amo."
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,PHIL,138,Heideggers Being and Time,000138,2025 Fall,4,Tue/Thu,09:00 AM,10:15 AM,Peter Gordon Martin,Arts and Humanities,,"Peter Gordon Martin Heidegger's famous first book, Being and Time, is one of the most important philosophical works of the twentieth century. It existentializes Aristotle's ontology, systematizes the existential insights of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, and on that basis offers a radical critique of Husserl's phenomenological account of intentionality. The result is a dramatically original and compelling interpretation of the human condition. This interpretation leads, in turn, to an account of the nature of philosophical and scientific inquiry, as well as their limitations. Being and Time has important implications for all those disciplines that study human beings. In this course we will explore major themes of this often bewildering work, with an emphasis on charitable interpretation: What is the 'question of Being?' What is the relationship between theoretical knowledge and understanding-by-doing? What is the nature of our social being? What does it mean to be 'inauthentic' or 'authentic,' and what are the implications of human finitude? Finally, what is the 'Question of Being'? Course Notes: This course is equivalent to Phil. 138.

The theory reliably accounts for the measurement results of atomic clocks and particle accelerators to many decimal places, and much of our modern technology relies on it. However, the theory's axiomatic foundations are arguably either inconsistent or incomplete, and there is still no consensus over what the theory entails about the world. This course will cover the century-long effort to resolve these mysteries and others, a story that features fantastical notions like parallel universes, pilot waves, quasi-probabilities, alive-and-dead cats, and spooky action at a distance. Throughout the course, we will engage with many relevant questions in philosophy, from determinism and causation to epistemology and the meaning of probability.Assessments: The course will have weekly homework assignments consisting of a mixture of primary-source readings, short essays, and mathematical exercises.

Much effort has been, and continues to be, expended in trying to defeat, or argue against, or undermine, skepticism. Here we will look at what happens if we take seriously the possibility that skepticism is actually true. How can we build a philosophy, and a life, that acknowledges the truth of skepticism? We will look at a number of different attempts to do this from a wide range of times. We will pay particular attention to the Ancient Greek Pyrrhonians and the Ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi, reading both the original texts and later commentaries on them.

When do two things make up another thing? What does it mean for one thing to be like another? How do things change while still being themselves? This course will introduce you to some of the most basic concepts and tools of metaphysics that will enable you to understand questions such as these and attempts to answer them, and ultimately to pose your own questions and craft your own answers. We will begin by investigating the nature and structure of ordinary objects, such as tables and chairs. We will then turn to questions concerning objects in space and time, as well as the nature and structure of space and time themselves. Along the way, we will also consider more curious entities such as holes and clouds, and explore connections to physics and science fiction, from the idea of extra spatial dimensions to the possibility of time travel."

Faculty of Arts and Sciences,PHIL,173E,Is Ethics Objective?,225918,2026 Spring,4,,,,,Arts and Humanities,,"Course is an introduction to contemporary metaethics. It will address questions like the following:Does the existence of widespread ethical disagreement mean that there can't be any objective facts and it's all just a matter of opinion? Can we reconcile the idea of an objective ethical reality with evolutionary and sociological arguments that explain how we developed our beliefs? Is it strange that there can be facts that tell you what to do?We will begin by examining three famous arguments for an anti-realist metaethics: J.L. Mackie's arguments from disagreement and from queerness, and Sharon Street's Darwinian dilemma. All three arguments challenge the idea that our ethical beliefs reflect some kind of mind-independent facts. We will begin to develop philosophical skills through close analysis of these arguments, identifying their logical structure and the places where they could be challenged. We will then apply these skills to a series of texts defending alternative metaethical views, including reductive and non-reductive naturalism, quasi-realism, and constructivism. We will explore those four positions and the main challenges for each of them. Throughout, we will ask whether our ethical beliefs are on surer footing than some other kinds of normative beliefs, especially beliefs about aesthetics, beliefs about rationality, and – most importantly – beliefs about what we should believe."

But if I agree to meet with you at a certain time and never show up, then you might feel resentment and complain to your friends -- especially if it turns out that I had no good reason for not showing up and I simply didn't feel like talking to you. These are examples of praise and blame, respectively. Praise and blame are ubiquitous parts of our interpersonal lives. But what, exactly, are these attitudes? (Hold on a minute, are they attitudes or behaviors?) And when, exactly, are they merited or deserved? In this course, we will examine some of the philosophical literature on agency and responsibility that underpins attributions of praiseworthiness and blameworthiness. We will discuss free will and moral luck; cognitive, affective, and motivational theories of blame; the epistemic condition and the control condition on responsibility; the standing to blame; forgiveness and repair; and the kinds of motivations that make people praiseworthy."

Although the idea of beauty is easily invoked, there are quite different ways of understanding it, varying between a characteristic of an object, or the perception of an object by persons, or even (as David Hume proposed) as something that exists merely in the mind. There are other understandings that are not so obvious, such as John Keats's belief that beauty is truth. Other than critically examining different understandings of beauty, we will be concerned with ideas of beauty that come from different fields of study or from distinct areas of interest.Those who would like to take our course should send us a transcript of their grades and a brief note saying how they might think about engaging with general ideas of beauty, or about specific insights that come from their own areas of interest.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences,PHYSICS,19,Introduction to Theoretical Physics,207005,2025 Fall,4,Mon/Wed/Fri,03:00 PM,04:15 PM,Jacob Barandes,Science & Engineering & Applied Science,,"Jacob Barandes, Gregorio Ponti, Anna Wang-Holtzen Physics 19 is a comprehensive introduction to the foundations of theoretical physics, with a first-principles approach to its five main areas: analytical mechanics, thermodynamics, fields, relativity, and quantum theory.The course is aimed primarily at students who are considering pursuing advanced study of physics in the concentration, as an option alongside Physics 15A and Physics 16. (Most physics concentrators start by taking either Physics 15A, 16, or 19.) The course is also open to undergraduate and graduate students in other fields of study—such as math, philosophy, astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, and engineering—who are interested in developing a better understanding of physics either to serve the needs of their own academic work or as a first step toward switching their area of study to physics.The purpose of the course is to present the foundations of modern theoretical physics in a welcoming setting for students from a variety of backgrounds. The course is intended to present a clear, faithful picture of what theoretical physics looks like. We will derive nearly everything from scratch in as self-contained a manner as possible—with occasional exceptions for special cutting-edge examples. We will also introduce all the necessary mathematics along the way.Specific topics will include Newtonian mechanics, chaos, perturbation theory, orbital mechanics, the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations, the connection between symmetries and conservation laws, statistical physics and thermodynamics, electromagnetism, special relativity, relativistic gravitation, black holes, and an extensive introduction to quantum theory. In-class discussions will regularly address relevant issues in the history and philosophy of physics, as well as the conceptual implications of our modern physical theories for making sense of the world around us.Cooperation and diversity strengthen our academic community, so the course will prioritize collaboration and aim to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for students with diverse identities and backgrounds. The instructor will help students form study groups as needed. Physics 19, called Principles of Scientific Inquiry (PSI), is a departmental requirement. (For students in Physics 19 who are not planning on concentrating in physics, PSI is not required.) Sign-ups for PSI will be arranged at the beginning of the semester. PSI topics will include experimental design, model testing, measurements, data collection, data and error analysis, basic programming, oral presentations, and scientific writing. PSI will meet weekly throughout the semester, and will emphasize collaborative teaching and learning. Physics 19 is mathematically intensive. The course will assume a working knowledge of single-variable differential and integral calculus at least at the level of Mathematics 1A, as well as a high comfort level with abstract concepts, but will not assume previous coursework in physics or multivariable calculus. Mathematics 1A is not a strict requirement, and students who are unsure whether they have adequate background should contact the instructor. The course will cover relevant topics from vector calculus, complex analysis, linear algebra, and other areas of mathematics as needed, so a prior familiarity with these subjects, while helpful, will not be required."

We will then examine the psychological biases and other mental quirks of our mind that make it hard for us to identify what actually makes us happy, and we will then discuss what recent research reveals about factors that promote happiness. Importantly, throughout the course, students will be invited to apply these strategies in everyday life. In other words, we will both discuss what new results in cognitive science suggest to anyone interested in better understanding the factors that promote happiness, and also actively put these scientific findings into practice. Along the way, we will review historical and cross-cultural views on the meaning of happiness, discuss the limitations of scientific approaches to the topic, and identify aspects of modern life (especially modern life at Harvard) that make it difficult to develop habits that support happiness. Finally, we will also discuss how to apply the new science of happiness beyond our own lives to improve our communities and our planet too."

How, and why, do our memories for emotional events differ from memories for mundane events? How does the brain process rewards, and respond to social rewards such as trust? What can we learn about implicit social biases from understanding their representation in the brain? What can we learn about the brain systems of human emotion and social interactions from studying other animals? Building on this foundational knowledge, we will explore how advances in human brain science might inform larger societal issues, including legal decisions, clinical interventions for the treatment of anxiety, and racial bias.

In this course, we will read neuroscience and cognitive psychology research articles as well as patient reports to explore the real causes, brain damage, and symptoms associated with different types of amnesia. We will discuss what types of memory are intact and impaired in different cases and what these profiles reveal about the underlying neural functioning and the patient's abilities.

Subsequently, we introduce model comparison including segmentedand polynomial regression, followed by a modern framework for modeling the effects ofpredictors in a truly nonlinear fashion: generalized additive models (GAM). GAM can beseen as an extension of the GLMM framework. The same applies to regression shrinkagetechniques like lasso and ridge which incorporate penalties into regression and can be usedfor predictor selection or multicollinearity scenarios. Next up are path models which giveus possibilities for structural regression extensions that go beyond standard multiple IVs,single DV settings. A popular example of such a structural extension are mediation modelswhich we cover in great detail, including longitudinal mediation.This is followed by causal inference which is all about making causal statements of the effect ofone variable onto another. We cover the potential outcomes framework, and revisit mediationwithin this context.

In this class we will cover a wide variety of modern psychometric methods; a big portion of them going beyond the classical psychometrics definition boundaries.The first half of the class covers a variety of exploratory scaling (unsupervised learning) methods. The aim is to scale and visualize association patterns in complex, multivariate datasets. Such techniques include principal components analysis (PCA), correspondence analysis (CA), Gifi methods, multidimensional scaling (MDS), and (social) networks.The second half of the class deals with parametric psychometric methods.We start with basic elaborations on measurement and reliability, before moving on to latent variable models. Within this context we cover exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and structural equation models which allow us to model complex relationships among (latent) variables. Finally we introduce item response theory, a measurement framework for categorical data. One overarching goal of these latent variable units is to replace a naive sum score by something more sophisticated.The last unit (psychometric theory) will be held by Richard McNally where he will talk about validity, and will cover theories of intelligence, personality, and behavior genetics fundamentals.All topics covered will be supported by corresponding computations and illustrations in R, and supported by lab sections.

It is also clear that the power of AI today is at an inflection point. The rise of deep learning architectures like the Transformer has yielded models capable of an array of impressive tasks, from seamless human-like conversation to composing symphonies. While these advances incorporate specialized machine learning models, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) present a broad array of possibilities. LLMs have surprised the scientific community and even their creators by exhibiting emergent abilities once thought to be uniquely human, such as fairly advanced cognition and reasoning, although the full extent of these accomplishments is debated. Yet, despite this excitement, substantive efforts at testing the cognitive and social abilities of general-purpose AI models is in its early stages. The technology behind ChatGPT, for example, while impressive, is not without problems, and even dangers. Research has shown that these models can amplify patterns of bias in their training corpus. While capable of passing standardized tests in varied domains, these models are strikingly poor at solving mathematical problems and transformers are more generally less successful in solving problems external to their training data. Despite these shortfalls, the promise of this technology – still in its infancy – is enormous. Because [t]he purpose of science is to develop, without prejudice or preconception of any kind, a knowledge of the facts, the laws, and the processes of nature we will apply this commitment to understanding the cognitive and social features revealed in ongoing discoveries (i.e., unpublished research) about LLMs by the participants in the course. This course is geared towards graduate students (and some qualified undergraduates) from various disciplines, especially psychology, computer science and related fields. Students will present their ongoing research to the class and as such, this course is only for students already engaged in research on the cognitive and social aspects of LLMs. This course will be organized like a lab meeting, with the weekly topics being constructed out of the projects of the participating students. The hope is that in this moment of rapid testing and learning, students will benefit from learning about the challenges each confronts and the advances each is making, to reduce the problem of each student reinventing the wheel. It is advisable to contact the instructor prior to registering for this course to discuss the value of the course to the student and the student to the course.

Students will moreover be encouraged to engage how these sources may prompt us to remember, or rather realize, that all aspects of material life, including animals' bodies, physical resources and technologies, were inextricably linked to the imagined non-material realms of the Unseen. On the whole, this seminar class takes steps towards recounting histories of religious animals and the Unseen."

Religious studies scholars, especially historians of religion, have attended to this quandary while sifting through archives of slavery, colonialism, conquest, and sexual violence. At Harvard, this conversation has re-emerged in unique ways through Harvard & the Legacy of Slavery: Reckoning with the Past to Understand the Present, and the question of what lies in university archives has taken center stage. This course examines these archival dilemmas and the violent hauntings of the past with an eye towards the historical study of religion in the Americas.

At issue is the role of religion and ethics in debates on law and justice. How, if at all, can religion as well as ethical frameworks explain the tension between law and justice and grapple with social matters that are legally protected but morally offensive."

This course will study the development of these four books and their transformation from texts into books with distinct physical and material features. In the case of each book, the text will be studied historically– excavated for its sources and roots, and its subsequent development over the centuries—and holistically, as a canonical document in Jewish tradition. Class time will be devoted primarily to learning to read the primary sources in translation; supplementary secondary readings will provide historical and cultural context. The seminar will also include regular visits to Houghton Library to look at manuscripts, early printed editions, and facsimiles of these books in order to study the changing shapes these books have taken as a key to understanding how they were studied and used, and to consider the relationship of materiality to textuality. While each book will raise its own set of issues, we will repeatedly deal with three basic questions: What makes a Jewish text? How do these books represent different aspects of Jewish identity? What can these books tell us about the canonical books of other religious traditions? No previous background in either Judaism or Jewish history is required. All readings in English translation. While this course is not a formal introduction to Judaism, it does aim to introduce students to Judaism and Jewish culture from inside its classic texts."

This course will survey the history of the daemon from the archaic period (e.g. Homer), through the classical and Hellenistic periods, to late antiquity, with a focus on Platonism's evolving interpretation of Socrates' own daemon and, more broadly, the relevance of daemons for the pursuit of philosophy. We use daemon to distinguish this wide tradition from the early Christian demonization of these intermediary beings.

In what ways do they reflect the major issues, concerns, and struggles that were taking place among the earliest Christ-followers? How did they get to be grouped together in a single book called the New Testament? In addition to these historical questions, we will also attend to the New Testament's ongoing role as Christian scripture to consider the following: what does it mean to study a religious text critically? How might the study of the New Testament's social and historical context relate to its ongoing role as sacred and/or authoritative in the Christian tradition? And what are some of the diverse ways that contemporary readers bridge the gap between the New Testament's ancient Greco-Roman context and their own interpretation and application? We will explore these questions through careful study of the New Testament texts themselves, while also attending to issues of historical context, methodology, and hermeneutics.

Later, in an interview with Professor Carrasco, Morrison stated, When I read his book One Hundred Years of Solitude, I literally said, Oh, my God, you can do this—meaning magic, strange stuff—and be deadly serious. So, that freed me up in my writing. Reading him unlocked something important for me. This course is a comparative and critical study of the religious dimensions in their writings and lives with special attention to the themes of religious experience, homeland and quests, Africa and Latin America, rememory and myths, goodness and the literary imagination.

CE) witnessed major religious transformations that still define our world today, including most importantly the rise of rival monotheisms, the Abrahamic traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. After suffering initial persecutions, Christianity gained imperial favor and grew rapidly in Asia, Europe, and Africa, supplanting traditional cults and overtaking other religions. During this same period, the rabbinic movement developed its foundational texts and became the chief expression of Judaism. Finally, ardent monotheists from Arabia conquered much of West Asia and North Africa and founded a distinct religion, Islam, to which the majority of the populations of these conquered regions eventually converted. This course examines some of the important figures, texts, trends, and controversies involved in these transformations, especially the rise of these rivals. We will also study how different religious communities— Christians, Jews, and Muslims, among others—interacted with each other during these centuries. Topics include revelation, theology, persecution, taxation, warfare, ethnic identity, polemic, law, and conversion."

In the recent history of Latin America, there are multiple instances where aesthetics and politics have intertwined in order to create and find new meanings for the issues plaguing the region. If a citizen participates in both the action of being governed and the action of governing, there is no doubt that aesthetics, understood as the formal exploration of the distribution of the sensible, as Rancière would say, is a productive space for analysis to understand Latin American intellectual and political traditions.In this course, we will panoramically explore the relationship between aesthetics and politics throughout the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries in Latin America. By studying cinema, literature, art, music, and more, the objective is to offer students an approach to how art and culture bear witness, often in a more visceral and affective way than is possible from a purely historiographical or sociological approach, to what politics cannot resolve. We will analyze and discuss Latin American productions based on key aesthetic concepts (manifesto, declamation, performance, documentary, etc.), in order to trace and outline the anxieties plaguing both art and contemporary Latin American criticism."

Having achieved independence from the Spanish crown, the newfangled republics were in dire need of a unifying discourse capable of weaving together history, identity, and political legitimacy. Each post-colonial state endeavored to articulate a coherent narrative that would cement its status as a nation, recognizable across the ages. The difficulties entailed in erecting such 'foundational fictions' were daunting, and Latin American historians, regardless of their ideology, drew on their ample literary skills to solve them. Their oeuvre, often epic in style and overwhelming in scholarship, offers a window into that nation-building era in which the boundaries between history and literature were still porous and undefined.This course serves as an introduction to 19th century Latin American historiography and its intimate but problematic relationship with literature. In analyzing these historical masterpieces, students will become acquainted with their virtues, shortcomings, and lasting impact while discovering the complicated history they portray. In order to do so, the course will combine close- readings of the historiographical canon with pertinent secondary literature on the topic, such as Karl Löwith, Hayden White, Ivan Jablonka, and Germán Colmenares, among others."

We will learn how to analyze the complexities of film and photography, considering movies, documentaries, photographs, and other visual materials which cover past and present migrations from Africa, America, Asia, and Europe. We will also study the history of migrations, and will examine the intricacies of the concept of migrant (as both emigrant and immigrant), paying particular attention to the different stages of migrants' journeys (the departure from the home country; the crossing of transit countries and borders; the arrival; and the settlement or forced deportation).

Far from static or monolithic, the richness, variety, and controversial character of such a long- lasting presence is reflected in the history of Latin American thought: among the many intellectuals influenced by Catholicism, one finds prophetic crusaders, poetic nuns, pious indigenists, radical liberals, reactionary antimoderns, authoritarian politicians, conservative feminists, ecclesiastical fascists, left-wing revolutionaries, and even a Pope. Catholicism has been, throughout the centuries, a never-ending source of inspiration for all sorts of intellectual traditions in the region.The objective of this course is to introduce students to Catholicism's deep and lingering imprint in Latin America by means of a close-reading approach to some of its main intellectual figures, from the 15th century to the 21st. More than an institutional history of the Church, the course offers a survey of Latin American Catholic thought across the ages, focusing on its unceasing dynamism and intellectual heterogeneity.

In the face of the global socio- environmental crisis caused by extractivist policies and the manipulation of the temporalities of nature, contemporary Latin American novels represent instances of resistance to capitalist exploitation and alternative ways of relating with the environment. In order to explore what I call eco-affective imaginings, we will read novels written and published in Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile whose central characters confront, domesticate or reconcile with nature (from Samantha Schweblin's Distancia de rescate and Mike Wilson's Leñador to Fernanda Trías' Mugre Rosa and Gabriela Cabezón Cámara's Las Aventuras de la China Iron, and Las niñas del naranjel). Our interdisciplinary approach to the political nature of these fictions will allow us to foreground literature's potential to activate eco-affective practices, imagine new ways of inhabiting the world, explore the power of critical thought to intervene in contemporary societal debates and engage in the collective construction of the present. This course will be taught by Prof. Alejandra Laera."

In this course we'll look at recent Latin American literature that establishes a sometimes productive, other times disruptive relationship with archives and criticism, in contrast to previous works that have delved into the archives for their literary production. Delving into the pressures and challenges faced by contemporary Latin American authors such as Jazmina Barrera, Mariana Enriquez, Fernando Vallejo, among others, as they navigate the dual demands of producing literature that is both critically relevant and culturally resonant, amidst the backdrop of archival extractivism and a fast-evolving literary landscape, the course will offer a panoramic approximation to how intertwined literary production and literary criticism can be, and the consequences this has on both the literary field and academia. The combined concepts of critical obsolescence and archival mining aim to explore how these forces impact the creation, reception, and interpretation of literature in Latin America. Authors seem to find themselves negotiating between the vast historical and cultural tapestries available through the regions' archives and the demands for fresh, relevant narratives in a global literary market. This places a particular type of pressure on authors and critics in Latin America to continuously innovate or react to new developments, which can render previous interpretations quickly obsolete, but that also assume certain tightness in regard to the possibilities of the hermeneutical process itself."

Faculty of Arts and Sciences,FRENCH,104,Care Crisis: Late Medieval Vulnerabilities,226500,2025 Fall,4,,,,,,,"The period known as the long fourteenth century, the French kingdom and its people suffered unprecedented violence, corruption, and loss. Imbricating vulnerabilities exposed by plague, the Hundred Years' war, civil war, pillaging, famine, mental illness, and greed created anincreasingly untenable crisis of care. Equally unprecedented was the sensitivity of late medieval literary writers to these events. Far from serving as mouthpieces to the powerful or entertainers who distract from reality, the literary community spoke out, whether by constructing alternativenarratives, meditating on experiences of fragility and trauma, exposing hidden inequities that target the most vulnerable, or cultivating cultures of care. What can the literature of this period tell us about what it means to be vulnerable? Or what it means to encounter vulnerability with care? Can the intimate activities of writing and reading become a means of expressing, exposing, soliciting, enacting, or provoking such encounters? In this course we will explore these questionsthrough selected works of poetry, prose, music, manuscript documentary evidence, and modern criticism to discover a shared commitment among late medieval literary writers to challenge dominant discourses of power and resiliency, asserting the value of different forms of vulnerability and calling for urgently needed ethics and politics of care.

In doing so, we will see how the relation between fiction and reality, between the text and the world, is anything but simple, or merely reflective.

Knowledge about the world seemed to flow through the figure and the body of the prostitute. In this course, we will situate this knowledge production within the histories of prostitution, social investigation, the city of Paris, and the novel in order to understand why this was the case.

Conversely we will investigate ecological resistance, such as the Creole gardens historically nurtured by enslaved communities to counter food scarcity on plantations, or the mangrove forests on and around which diasporic communities continue to live and live from.

He lived and thrived amid the world's most dynamic crossroads of cultures, languages, and trade routes of his era. Boccaccio is a walking archive of the medieval orders and a herald, anarchic and experimental, of the Renaissance. He is literature—literature as storytelling, healing, and pastime—but also as a means of manufacturing affective communities and preserving collective memory. He was a restless scribe who spent his life, to the very last days, salvaging stories of others, amassing fragments of historical, geographical, and mythological information, redefining each of these domains in the process. This course centers on his vernacular masterpiece, the Decameron: 100 tales spun over 10 days by 7 young women and 3 young men fleeing plague-ravaged Florence. We will discuss gender dynamics—the book's dedication to women and its misogynistic portrayals—Boccaccio's narrative recombination, a storytelling method that changed European literary history and prefigures modern generative AI."

From the shores of Ningbo to the deserts of Los Alamos, though its names have changed, its essence remains the same. It is Hesiod's chaos, the tehom of Genesis (1:2), Plato's chōra, Aristotle's prote hyle, the silva of Latin hylomorphism, the alchemical lapis, and the sterile neutrino. Prime matter is the gateway to manipulating the very fabric of the physical world, to obtain gold, eternal youth, healing, perpetual energy, a new or meta-universe, or the crafting of the greatest literary masterpiece of all time. The ancient mythographers did not surrender to the resigned conclusions of logic, but instead depicted matter in the form of a god. They named it Proteus, proto-theos, the azure entity capable of becoming anything, the inkwell into which any pen that writes of transmutation and change has been dipped. This advanced seminar offers students the possibility to reassemble an intergenerational conversation on the concept of pure matter with original, comparative readings of the Proteus myth as it appears in Homer, Virgil, Plutarch, the Carolingians, Jean du Meun, Dante, Ariosto and Tasso– while also adumbrating its continuation in the writings of Giordano Bruno, Goethe, Shelley, and Primo Levi. Particular attention will be paid to both Bibelalchemie and mythoalchemie."

SOC-STD 50 Foundations of Social Science Research Matt Reichert This course introduces students to the diversity of methods that social scientists use to answer questions about the social and political world. We survey both qualitative and quantitative approaches, and consider how to make the most of each at all stages of the research process, from exploring ideas, to collecting evidence, to communicating findings. Students learn how to conduct interviews and focus groups, use archives and primary sources creatively, and design interesting case studies. Students also learn how to conduct in-depth ethnographic observation, use an array of quantitative tools, run surveys, and understand the logic of experiments and causal inference. We consider how deeper epistemological commitments shape our methodological choices, and how politics and power shape the scientific communities in which we work. Course assignments help thesis-writers explore potential topics and prepare them to immediately conduct productive original research. Sectioning will be scheduled after enrollment. This class is designed for juniors concentrating in Social Studies; sophomores, seniors, and students from other concentrations should contact the instructor before petitioning to enroll.

SOC-STD 60 Making Sense of Methods for Theoretical and Historical Research Charles Clavey, Sarah Greenberg This course has three interrelated aims. First, it will introduce students to the foundational questions of the philosophy of social science. How do social scientists and theorists interpret and explain the world around them? How are models and concepts created and applied? What does it mean to argue that one event causes another one? Second, the class will familiarize students with the range of theoretical and historical methods that could be used in a senior thesis. What are the established and cutting-edge paradigms of social-science research? Where do these disciplines converge and diverge? What topics and questions are best suited to each method? Third, the course will prepare juniors and first-semester seniors to undertake thesis research. Through a range of exercises and activities, students will shape their interests into precise questions and feasible projects. In deciding which approach might be the most apt for their theses, they will confront the stakes—practical, philosophical, and political—of methodological choices. SOC-STD 68LS Land, Space, and Politics Benjamin Mueser After the Civil War, formerly enslaved and free black people maintained that their freedom required land of their own, an idea embodied in the Reconstruction era promise of '40 acres and mule.' Beginning in the 1950s, an American 'back-to-the-land' movement formed, insisting that restoring democracy required returning to agrarian lives. In November 1969, a group of Indigenous activists occupied Alcatraz Island, claiming that a 1851 treaty required retired federal lands to be returned to Indigenous peoples. Since early colonization and to the present, Americans have practiced 'squatting' to claim lands and spaces as their own, even without legal title. These are very different events, but they share a common theme. Each prompt us to consider the central importance of spatial belonging and situatedness to political life. What did the land mean to these people? What does it mean to us? What is it, exactly, that we are demanding when we demand a space for our own? This class will address these questions with interdisciplinary readings on the relationships we form toward the land. Our goal is to not isolate abstract scholarship, but instead to examine the connections between theory and praxis, and to highlight how we can apply the theories we discuss in class. Toward that end, the class will be organized around 5 modules, foregrounding present-day and historical movements, following by theoretical reflections. Our guiding principle will be that practice has more to teach theory than the other way around, and good applied theory takes a critical approach to each.

SOC-STD 98CL Law and American Society Terry Aladjem At a time when the rule of law is imperiled, our democracy and equal rights of every kind under assault by multiple forces, the importance of understanding our constitutional system of rights and laws as essential to the fabric of the nation cannot be overstated. The course will examine law as a vehicle of political conflict and a deﬁning force in American society in four dimensions: 1.) as it establishes individual rights, liberties, and the limits of toleration; 2.) as it attempts to resolve differences among competing constituencies; 3.) as it sets out terms of punishment and social control having effects on race and class, and 4.) as a source of informing images and ideological meaning. We will examine these themes with close attention to their historical roots and their constitutional and theoretical origins, to their manifestations in our current political discourse. We will take up issues at the level of jurisprudence or political theory, but also as they arise in public controversies, or are settled in legal cases by the courts—cases in which racial or gender equality are at stake, religious or sexual freedom, cases in which the nature and content of political speech are questioned, cases in which the imperatives of religious communities seem irreconcilable with public institutions, cases in which the nature and extent of punishment have been debated and the question of who deserves to be punished decided, and notorious public trials in which the national self-understanding has been shaped. Our aim is to bring theory to bear, and down to earth, in each consideration (we will read Foucault's Discipline and Punish, and also examine prisons and mass incarceration). This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98EO Art, Political Culture, and Civic Life Kiku Adatto The seminar explores the interplay of the arts, political culture, and civic life. It will draw on studies in art, history, political philosophy, literature, sociology, and photography. Among the questions we will address are: How is historical memory constructed, and what are the competing forces that shape it? What is the significance of public apologies, and does solidarity create moral responsibilities for historical injustices? How is cultural domination exerted, and how is it resisted? In what ways does rhetoric shape politics, and what role does it play in national narratives? Why does the contest to control images loom so large in politics, the media, and in our everyday lives? This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98GV The Governance of Artificial Intelligence Joan O'Bryan Are we about to be replaced? Some experts have predicted the rise of Artificial General Intelligence—and machines which could outperform humans at nearly every task—as soon as the end of this decade. What exactly is artificial intelligence, where is it headed, and what does it mean for us? This junior tutorial explores the most recent philosophical and policy challenges raised by this emerging technology, with the aim of enabling students to develop an original research project on an unanswered question concerning the impact of AI on human society. These questions may include: under what conditions do chatbots deserve legal personhood or protections? How should we regulate frontier models, and what are the guiding assumptions behind the AI safety movement? Do rich countries have a duty of justice to provide global access to advanced computer chips and open-source LLM code? Can big data improve democratic functioning, and if so, at what cost? And what should we do in the face of the singularity? Overall, students will develop an understanding of the technical basics of machine learning and the material conditions required to enable its development, examine a number of case studies on AI's current and prospective impacts, and critically engage with key debates in AI ethics and governance. SOC-STD 98LF Globalization and the Nation State Nicolas Prevelakis As globalization faces challenges, the nation-state and nationalism have resurged, influencing global and local identities. This course examines why, focusing on the nature of nationalism, ethnic conflicts, the rise of populism and authoritarianism, and global issues such as inequality, migration, and climate change. Through theoretical texts and case studies from various regions, including the U.S., Europe, and China, students will explore the renewed importance of nationalism and the nation-state in the current global landscape. This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98MM Asian Cities: Multiple Modernities and Global Connections Xinyu Guan What does studying Asian cities teach us about cities, and about Asia writ large? Through engaging with ethnographies and urban theories, we will explore themes such as (post)colonialism, multiple modernities, informality, neoliberalism, (post)socialism, migration, and diaspora. This course will be of interest to students with an interest in urban-related topics in general, with no background knowledge on Asia required. In addition to cities situated within Asia, we will examine diasporic urban spaces and communities physically outside of Asia. Alongside the course themes, we will analyze and learn how to conduct ethnography and interviews, in addition to analyzing maps and archival material. There will be an ethnographic assignment, where students will learn to conduct an in-person ethnographic observational exercise of an Asia-related space or community in the Boston area. For the culminating final assignment, students will pick one of the methods to conduct original research and write a 20-25-page paper. This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98ND Justice and Reconciliation after Mass Violence Jonathan Hansen This seminar examines the problem of justice and reconciliation after mass violence: How does a nation sundered by genocide, civil war, or gross human rights violations reestablish the social trust and civic consciousness required of individual and collective flourishing? What is the proper balance between individual and collective responsibility? What is the role of trials, truth commissions, and apology in civil reconciliation? How do specific types of mass violence influence outcomes? What makes some reconciliations successful, others less so? The course engages these and other questions from historical and contemporary perspectives, exploring the legacy of mass violence going back centuries, while examining reconciliation projects across cultures, countries, and continents.This course comprises three units: 1) a typology of mass violence (civil war, genocide, state repression, for instance) and historical responses; 2) case studies of the U.S. Civil War (and its continuing legacy), the Troubles (N. Ireland), and the Rwandan genocide; and 3) a research and writing workshop emphasizing students own work. The goal of the course is to introduce students to the literature of mass violence from an interdisciplinary perspective (including but not limited to historical, sociological, and anthropological approaches), ultimately launching students on their own research projects. This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98PM Political Myth Benjamin Mueser Political myth, or ideologically-marked narratives that are essential to the identity of a social group, has often been thought of as antithetical to political theory. By obscuring the truth in false narratives, or by communicating truths through narrative and arational means, myth has been interpreted as hostile to freedom, liberalism, rationalism, and deliberative democracy. And yet, despite Max Weber's claim that the modern world had become 'disenchanted,' the last century saw an explosion of political myths implicitly and explicitly driving mass political movements. Political myth prompts key questions about political theory: Is it possible or even desirable to have a politics without myth? If not, then what role exactly does myth play in politics? Can political myths be open to contestation and reevaluation? Under what conditions can political myth be a means of oppression, and under what conditions can it serve emancipatory ends? To address these questions, this class will examine the relationship between myth and politics through a series of major theoretical statements drawn mostly from European intellectual history followed by a series of case studies. This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98PO States, Empires, and Postcolonialism Yasemin Bavbek This seminar introduces major approaches to empires in social sciences, with a particular focus on the global and postcolonial turns and their critiques. We will discuss canonical works of postcolonialism, subaltern studies, and the Black Radical Tradition together with contemporary empirical work on empires. This seminar aims to 1) develop a comprehensive understanding of the conceptual toolkit of postcolonial thought and the Black Radical Tradition while addressing the sociopolitical contexts which gave rise to them, 2) compare postcolonial approaches to other major paradigms of anti-imperialist thought, and 3) survey approaches to empires and borderlands that do not conform to the categories of postcolonial thought. We will explore imperial legacies in social thought, political organization, and state formation from an interdisciplinary perspective. Some of the questions this seminar addresses are: How are racialization and empire related in different contexts? How can we apprehend the histories of (physical, epistemic, symbolic etc.) violence and extraction from a subaltern anti- imperial perspective? How do the metropoles and colonies relate to and constitute each other? Do empires learn from each other, and if so how? How do imperial relations structure contemporary politics, culture, and power relations? What forms does imperial domination and resistance against empire take? This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98PV The Critical Theory of the Frankfurt School Charles Clavey This course examines the distinctive critical theory created by members of the Institute for Social Research— better known as the Frankfurt School—from its origins in the interwar era to the present day. Over these decades, critical theory has used tools from philosophy, psychology, and sociology to grasp the pathologies of the present and to chart a path towards emancipation in the future. We will reconstruct the Frankfurt School's evolving theory through its connections to the most important themes of twentieth-century thought: capitalism, authoritarianism, individuality, bureaucracy, and alienation. Our goal is not only to gain a deep understanding of critical theory but also to assess its continued relevance to modern social and political thought. This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98RI Religion in Politics Sarah Greenberg This course problematizes the place, space, and role of religion in political and social life. We will question how, when, and why religion shapes, generates, and complicates politics, and if religion as such ontologically belongs to any political party or location on a right-left spectrum or a public-private distinction. We will explore these dynamics through primary and secondary works of political theory and intellectual history, and focus on ideas, concepts, and traditions such as civil religion, secularism, pluralism, liberalism, authority, identity, and more. Assignments in this course are focused on completing an independent research paper by the end of the term, emphasizing theoretical and historical methods. This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98SE Race, Ethnicity, and Inequality Christina Ciocca Eller The United States is more racially and ethnically diverse than at any point in its history. Yet racial and ethnic social categories remain persistent sources of inequality in American society. This tutorial will interrogate the relationships between race, ethnicity, and inequality, examining theoretical and empirical approaches across multiple social domains. Part I of the course focuses on the historical development and contemporary meanings of both race and ethnicity in the United States. Part II discusses the reproduction of social categories and the consequences of reproduction for inequality. Part III examines the relationship between race, ethnicity, and inequality in particular social domains, including neighborhoods, youth experiences, policing and mass incarceration, higher education, and the labor market. And Part IV dives deep into the issue of within-group inequalities by race and ethnicity, while also introducing global comparative approaches. We will discuss the implications for public policy through each of these case studies, focusing on strategies for reducing racial and ethnic inequality. This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98SR Slavery and Race in American Law John Harpham This course will explore the relationship between enslavement and racialization in American law. The course will start from the premise that American slavery was an institution that enlisted law in support of power and exploitation. As the institution transformed over time, so did the contours of the law. The course will first examine the early-modern Atlantic world, where we will compare the legal regimes of slavery in the British, French, and Spanish empires. We will use various kinds of documents to structure our inquiries, from statutes and law codes to legal treatises and appellate opinions to works of scholarship and the first-person narratives of persons who have been enslaved. This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98SS Statecraft and Sexuality Miriam Gleckman-Krut Sexuality is central to modern statecraft. This junior tutorial explores how – and why – states regulate sex, sexual violence, sexual taboos, sexual identities, and even talk of sex. Through attention to cases in North America and Southern Africa, we learn how sexuality is embedded in state formation, in the distribution of citizenship entitlements, and in efforts to maintain political legitimacy. Transnational comparisons elucidate generalizable features of sexuality and statecraft, as well as historical moments in which states learn from one another about how to deploy sexuality as a technology of power. Our examination of cases in the Global North and South exposes how these state processes operate in the context of global inequalities. This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98UD Critical Theory of Knowledge, Technology and Power Bo-Mi Choi This tutorial explores the role and impact of science and technology on society, culture, and politics from the perspective of critical theory. Building on the foundations of Marxian philosophy and the works of 20th-century critical theorists such as Lukáçs, Benjamin, Heidegger, Marcuse, and Foucault, we will explore more recent contributions in the philosophy and post-phenomenology of technology as well as social constructivism and feminist theory. While largely designed as a theory course, this tutorial takes a closer look at artificial intelligence, automation and robotics, surveillance capitalism, data feminism, and digital culture to investigate how these new technologies shape our social reality. The tutorial ends with a module on Afrofuturism as a potentially emancipatory form of techno-utopianism. Questions we will address along the way include: how do science and technology transform and mediate human experience and knowledge of the world? radically affect our political and social order? shape concepts of human subjectivity and regulate human behavior? And what kinds of political, ethical, and aesthetic consequences do we need to consider as we adopt new technology? Rather than conceptualizing science and technology in Promethean terms as tools of progress, we will closely examine how they are intrinsically constitutive of the ways we experience ourselves and the world around us. The aim is to collaboratively articulate, over the course of the semester, an amplified social theoretic framework that enables us to critically engage with the existential challenges and potential dangers of new technology and normatively evaluate scientific and technological innovations from the standpoint of human flourishing. SOC-STD 98VT Solidarity: Group, Self, Identity Rosemarie Wagner People are fighting for themselves and they're fighting for one another, but how do you figure out whom to stand with, and when and how? People with different experiences, beliefs, and commitments, are struggling, fighting, and organizing to get free from oppression and empower themselves. This course examines how agency, solidarity, and coalition can be possible in our post-foundational world, and how we bridge the gap between social theory and social action. Can we theorize a self or a group identity without relying on on essentialist and perhaps harmful beliefs? We will learn from theoretical debates in feminist, queer, Black, democratic, radical, postcolonial, and disability studies on questions of agency, solidarity, and liberation, and will also analyze real- world case studies of coalitions. This course focuses on theoretical and historical methodology. This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98WA Crime, Punishment, and Policing in an Unequal America Adaner Usmani The United States imprisons more people per capita than any comparable society, past or present. It is alone among developed countries in annually killing hundreds of its citizens in police encounters. And it is also, by some distance, the most violent country in the developed world. These facts raise a range of difficult questions about what should be done about crime, incarceration and policing in today's United States. The aim of this course is to give students the tools to better understand the empirical and normative dimensions of these questions. Throughout, we will be using reasoning and methods from both the empirical social sciences and from analytic moral and political philosophy. Students will be pushed to develop the strongest possible arguments for positions they may not endorse, and to argue against the perspective of the instructor at every opportunity. SOC-STD 98WB Inequality Under Capitalism Adaner Usmani All capitalist societies are characterized by significant forms of inequality. Some people and some groups have more of the things that we think make for a good life, while other people and other groups have less. But inequality is not static; not all societies are equally unequal. Social and political movements have transformed the distribution of well-being in numerous ways. This class ponders the empirical and normative questions raised by these facts. First, what explains inequality? Why do some people have more than others? Second, what should be done about these facts? What kinds of inequalities do we care about? What does justice require? And, given that only some of what justice requires is feasible, what should we demand? SOC-STD 98WD The Politics of Health and Medicine in the United States Matt Reichert How does politics shape our health? In this multidisciplinary class, students explore the historical origins of institutions like Medicare and Medicaid, the FDA, and the NIH. We seek to explain the politics of why American healthcare policy differs so dramatically from its peers, with narrowly targeted public programs and a dominant private insurance sector. Students learn how epidemiologists and clinicians today think about social determinants of health, especially racial disparities in care and outcomes. We conduct deep dives into topics like the sociology of mental illness, maternal mortality, the Affordable Care Act, Covid-19, and the medical ecosystem here in Boston. We consider normative questions, like how to balance cultural competency or patient autonomy with the medical mission to provide care and prevent harm. Finally, students also observe how public health researchers make use of social science methods, from the ethnographic case study to the clinical trial. This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98WH Climate Justice: The Politics of Decarbonization Jonathan Masin-Peters Given the urgent need to shift societies away from carbon-based energy, how can such transitions occur so as not to reproduce existing injustices? Answering this question requires an interdisciplinary approach. Texts from historians and anthropologists will provide insight into how societies across time and space have made large- scale energy transitions. Political science scholarship will contribute knowledge about political transitions, which were widespread in the twentieth century, from socialist transitions in the early twentieth century to democratic transitions in the post-Cold War era. Texts by political theorists and philosophers will enable conceptual analysis of ideas like democracy, injustice, and nature. At the same time, work by sociologists will attune students to the forms of stratification and inequality energy transitions are likely to foster. Finally, literary and cultural criticism will provide insights into the interpersonal tensions, nuances, and lived experiences of people undergoing large- scale changes. Students will build their conceptual vocabulary, learn the strengths and limits of each disciplinary approach, and understand how to formulate compelling research questions and problems. This is a junior tutorial. SOC-STD 98WM Infrastructure, Mediation, Sociality William Stafford Infrastructures make their social significance felt in a variety of ways: through the technologies that mediate their use, the materials from which they are made, and their sensory and aesthetic presence in our everyday lives. How does database design impact how we buy and sell things? How is wood sourced and processed for the construction of housing stock? What might a bridge do besides facilitate a crossing? Each of these aspects of infrastructure can exert their influence at multiple scales and in multiple ways, often anchoring diverse landscapes of experience across populations, communities, and individuals. In this course, we will explore how the infrastructures that organize social life are formed, experienced, and interpreted as the things and also the relations between things (Larkin 2013) that give shape to gender, race, caste, colonialism, imperialism, commerce, environment, government, protest, and abolition. In turn, we will explore how the study of infrastructure offers a unique perspective for theorizing the social in social theory and how imaginations of what is necessary for social life mediate the demands we make on theory and our own research. Materials for the course will draw on a broad corpus of readings, films, television shows, games, and technical documents across the disciplines of anthropology, sociology, history, visual studies, media studies, and science and technology studies. Coursework will involve ethnographic experiments with the local built environment and digital artefacts, the production of individual research archives, and the completion of an empirically grounded research project.

We begin by reading the standard sociological canon—Marx, Weber, and Durkheim—and interrogating why their ideas were canonized over others. We then read scholars who have been historically written out of the social sciences to evaluate their important, yet historically underappreciated, contributions. By the end of the course, students should (1) master key concepts in classical sociological thought, (2) understand what it means to theorize, and what makes for good theory, and (3) learn to critically interrogate the relationship between power, standpoint, and the production of knowledge."

To this end, we will explore questions that consider elements of the history of Latin America as part of what shapes the trajectories of Latinx in the US. What are the lasting impacts of Spanish colonization in Latin America that shape immigration into the US? What are the origins of the Hispanic/Latino category? How are Latinxs' immigrants experiencing this identity and what are its implications to their social and political incorporation in the US? We will focus on three areas: (1) the legacies of the former Spanish colonies in Latin America; (2) the parallels between the categories of Hispanic/Latino in the US and Mestizo in Latin America; and (3) the social and political incorporation of Latinx populations in the United States, with particular attention to how the process of immigrant incorporation relates to immigrants' premigration experiences. Students will have the opportunity to develop an original research project on a topic relevant to this course. The methodological focus will be qualitative in-depth interviews from an inductive research approach. Accordingly, from the third week of the course, students will conduct 2-3 exploratory interviews on a broad topic they are interested in, which will then inform the research question that will guide their research question and subsequent data collection.

We will ask questions like: how do individuals or groups become stigmatized? How do people experience, cope with, or resist this stigma? How is stigma tied to discrimination, or the unequal access to resources and opportunities? And how might we reduce or challenge stigma? How can we promote its opposite, social recognition?Together, we will unpack the concept of stigma by diving into case studies. We will discuss the stigmas associated with dirty work, polluted relationships, illness, disability, poverty, criminal records, and more. We will also analyze the ways stigma intersects with class, race, gender, and sexuality. Our approach will be both micro-sociological — looking at individuals and social interactions — as well as meso-sociological — studying organizations, institutions, cultural scripts, and power.During the semester, you will also conduct your own research on stigma and recognition. You will learn to use and apply qualitative methods, either ethnography, participant observation, in-depth interviews, textual analysis, or archival work. You will also receive individualized support as you prepare your final project. By the end of the course, you will have a clearer sense of the mechanisms by which stigma contributes to social inequalities."

What is the role of the individual in it? How can we change our societies? This course introduces students to the field of sociology. By surveying social theory as well as empirical studies, students acquire what C. Wright Mills calls the sociological imagination: the ability to think beyond our personal lives and to connect the experiences of individuals with large social structures. We examine common-sense assumptions about culture, politics, history, and psychology, and empower students to replace them with evidence-based reasoning. This gateway course introduces students to the intellectual insights and analytical tools of Sociology across the subfields of race, class, gender, politics, violence, culture, and inequality. Students are trained to critically analyze the evidence and research methods used in sociological research, and to communicate sociological ideas powerfully and succinctly through effective policy writing. Whether you plan to become a doctor who understands the social determinants of health, an education expert seeking to improve US schools, a not-for-profit worker supporting community organization, or a corporate consultant looking to improve organizational efficiency, the foundational concepts and research practices of sociology will empower you to understand, analyze—and maybe even change—our social world."

But the production, conservation and distribution of power and authority occur far beyond Capitol Hill: in families, neighborhoods, schools, foreign relations, welfare policies, social movements, nation-states and war. Why do people vote against their own interests? How do children rebel against their families? Why is growing up in a certain neighborhood associated with powerlessness? What kinds of governments are there, and could be? Why do civil wars start? In this course, we will examine such areas using the theoretical framework and analytic tools of political sociology. We will survey exemplar studies and consider different ways of conceptualizing power: from the micro level of the family to the macro level of geopolitics. Theoretical works are combined with practical applications and illustrations in specific national and historical contexts. Through quizzes and section discussions, students will acquire proficient knowledge of the central themes, methods and empirical concerns of political sociologists.

Why do some work fulfilling jobs from home, while others toil in someone else's factories or fields? Why do some eat cake while others nibble on roti? Why, in other words, do some people have a lot but others so little? This course uses the tools of the social sciences to examine the distribution of human well-being, or inequality. Together, we will survey this distribution across three broad eras of human history: the pre-agrarian era (until about 5-10,000 years ago), the agrarian era (ca. 5- 10,000 years ago to 200 years ago), and, especially, the modern world (ca. 200 years ago to the present). Our primary goal will be to answer empirical questions–to describe and explain these distributions–but we will also consider the normative challenges that lie behind them. What kinds of inequalities should we care about? And, given what we know about inequality today, what should we demand that people and governments do about them? Topics covered will include: the nature of early human societies, the origins of agriculture, the rise of the state, the birth of capitalism, the causes of racial inequality and patriarchy, and the transformation of capitalism by social and political movements.

Under what circumstances are work cultures a source of identity, meaning, and fulfillment? How are they used for control and domination? We will examine the varieties of culture at work by comparing corporate culture, craft culture, and caring labor. The course will then turn to contemporary forms of work which are characterized by flexibility, contingency, and insecurity. We will examine flexibility in working-class jobs and gig work alongside parallel developments among high-tech engineers and investment bankers. How does flexible labor shape workers' identities? What does it mean to be an independent contractor or entrepreneur in finance versus trucking? How is joblessness and unemployment experienced in different contexts? Lastly, we will examine workplace collectivities and how they relate to conflict on the job. How do cultures of solidarity compare among factory workers, gig workers, service workers, tech professionals, and teachers?

These questions will be explored through topics such as: 1) the role of dignity in relation to individual and collective well-being; 2) how people find hope in narratives when the future is especially uncertain; 3) how Gen Zs are dealing with the decline of upward mobility by embracing specific narratives; 4) how people bolster their dignity through work, environmental justice and politics; 5) how class cultures are changing at the top and at the bottom of the social ladder; and 6) how social movements and other agents of change provide cultural alternatives in the increasingly hybrid public sphere.We will look at the United States through comparative lenses to improve our understanding of the social and political world as we experience it today. Empirical cases will concern immigrant groups, indigenous people, LGBTQ+ communities, and professionals and workers in different national contexts and economic sectors."

This course examines the social world of poverty in the US today. It pays particular attention to the lived experiences of low-income people. It also examines the parallel sets of institutions low-income people must navigate—institutions that often perpetuate poverty, like low-wage jobs, systems of policing and surveillance, substandard schools and colleges, exploitative housing, and predatory financial services. The course places a heavy emphasis on firsthand experience and learning. We will have guest lectures from people whose work or life experiences relate to the course subject matter. Students will also complete several fieldwork assignments, doing things like observing eviction court, applying for food stamps, or interviewing someone making ends meet at a low-wage job.

Through the lens of the sociology of culture, we will examine how people create and disseminate conspiracy theories, as well as how people have used them as tools for analyzing power dynamics, creating distinctions between groups and ideas, and for making sense of some of the inexplicable and confusing realities of social life. Students will also learn about a few verified conspiracies and their consequences for institutional trust, critically examine the stigma that surrounds the conspiracy theorist label, and analyze conspiracy theories in popular culture.

Faculty of Arts and Sciences,SOCIOL,1204,Propaganda and Persuasion,224597,2026 Spring,4,Mon,03:00 PM,05:00 PM,,Social Sciences,Instructor Permission Required,"Sarah Halford Propaganda is a persuasive tool that has been used for centuries, but the continued development of communication technologies has exposed us to more of it than ever before. Propaganda is disseminated through forms of mass and social media, and it is used in political campaigns, during wartime, in advertising, art, film, music, journalism, and even in education. However, just because propagandists attempt to persuade you doesn't mean that it will work every time. A variety of factors, particularly other people in our social networks, can prime us for manipulation, but they can also protect us from being manipulated. The intimate connections we maintain with others and the kind of circles we run in may even predict which types of propaganda we will believe and why. In this class, we will take a sociological perspective to the study of propaganda and persuasion in media. This means that we will analyze uses of propaganda in the context of social conditions rather than focus on purely psychological factors that may lead to persuasion (though we'll look at those, too). You will learn about what propaganda is and its connection to communication technologies, techniques that propagandists have used to persuade the public, and you will even dabble in the dark arts of propaganda creation. While this class includes some important theoretical elements, we will ground the theoretical in the practical by analyzing real propaganda campaigns from the 20th and 21st centuries."

This concern stems in part from the fact that disadvantaged groups tend to have poorer diets than their more advantaged peers. In order to understand socioeconomic and racial disparities in diet quality, we will examine how people's food choice is related to their material resources, to their social circumstances, and to the meaning that they attach to—and derive from—food. Additionally, we will consider how the public imagines that disadvantaged people eat and how these ideas themselves relate to social inequalities. In addressing these issues, we will consider several core questions: 1) How do patterns of food consumption reflect existing inequalities?, 2) How do patterns of food consumption contribute to social inequalities?, 3) How do cultural constructions of what people eat compound these inequalities?, and 4) How might we reduce food-related inequalities? While these questions focus on food, they will help us to think about structure, culture, agency, identity, and stigma more generally."

We first explore why bureaucracy proliferated since the late 19th century. Next, we look at the inner workings of bureaucratic organizations. Then, we look at what the proliferation of bureaucracy means for us as a society, especially young people, who are products and participants in these systems. Young people today navigate a world shaped by organizations, where institutional dependencies have replaced traditional sources of identity and support. Some of the most desired jobs college graduates chase are in large, complex organizations. This course invites us to examine the trade-offs between efficiency, control, and certainty versus creativity, ambiguity, and individuality in a society built on bureaucratic structures, values, and norms.

Resistance, the role of protests and social movements will be discussed, but our focus will be learning how to work with others to harness human agency, coalesce around shared values, build consensus and community power in service of freedom and justice in society. Power and the structures of inequality are central themes. To learn how and why organizing works, we will explore the literature across the social sciences and discuss recent history to examine alliances, coalitions, grassroots movements, and direct action over the last 20 years. This will draw on successful, failed, and muted organizing efforts across the cultural and socio-political spectrum, including the controversial, to learn how to build momentum, nurture community agency and self- determination. A central characteristic of this course is applying theory and learning from the past and present to inform organizing and community action efforts to impact the future.Students will connect the course to relevant efforts currently underway. Students will have the option to connect their work in the course to the causes they are interested in, student groups, external organizations or efforts they are involved with, or to an active grassroots community organizing effort in metro Boston focused on felony disenfranchisement.

Understanding the social side of climate change means shifting our attention from particles to people. We address such questions as: What is it about modern social life that has caused climate change? Why have societies responded so slowly to the climate crisis? What do social movements for environmental justice and climate justice contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation? How can people use social processes and organizations to adapt to life on a changing planet? Along the way, we explore new research on surprising aspects of how humans as social animals relate to our environment. For instance: the place identity of wind turbines, the racial identity of electric vehicles, the gender of energy transitions, and the morality of climate projections.The overarching goal of the course, then, is to unveil the social causes and effects that are often hidden behind the geophysical models, climatological projections, and economic forecasts of conventional climate science. Specific goals include contributing to local community efforts to respond to climate change, understanding how climate science relates to climate politics, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative approaches to climate sociology.

The course is guided by three questions: (1) What is sociological about housing, and why should the study of housing be central to the discipline of sociology? (2) What have sociologists written about the long-term and day-to-day experiences of housing insecurity and homelessness? (3) How does housing inequality intersect with other dimensions of inequality? Through a combination of historical and contemporary readings, students will gain an understanding of the factors contributing to housing challenges, including a shrinking supply of affordable housing, inadequate wages and employment, discriminatory housing practices, and urban development. Students will also learn about how supply-side actors—such as landlords, real estate brokers, and building code inspectors—reproduce or exacerbate housing inequality; and why policy responses—like housing choice vouchers, emergency shelters, and supportive housing programs—do or do not seem to help."

This is the primary question that we will attempt to answer during the course of the semester in this seminar. The readings and discussion over the course of the term will parallel the development of the human being from conception, infancy and childhood, adulthood and sexuality, and will end with aging and death. We will take an interdisciplinary approach, and will examine textual materials from an extensive range of sources and time periods. Sources will include selections in translation from medical literature from India's Āyurvedic traditions as well as readings from religious narratives that deal directly with issues of embodiment and provide powerful metaphors for it. We will also be drawing largely on sociological and anthropological studies of the different forms that embodiment takes, from metaphysical issues on what it means to be alive or dead and the human body's connection to land and landscape to careful explorations ofthe body's outer surfaces in terms of ritual, ascetic, and strictly sartorial concerns with adornment and fashion.

It is meant to introduce students to ways of life that are informed by the most prominent sub-traditions of Hinduism today as they are reflected in the different versions of the Hindu calendar, also called Pañcāṅga or Pañjikā. Building on the history of different Hindu calendars, which consist of lunar dates (tithis), this course aims to give a broad overview of Hindu religious life as it revolves around festivals, fasts, seasonal rituals and pilgrimages that comprise each version of the calendar. Students will begin this journey with the Lunar New Year of the Vikrama Saṁvat calendar, which coincides with the end of the Spring Festival of Nine Nights (Caitra Navarātri) dedicated to the feminine divine, Śakti. After exploring the many ways in which the same event is celebrated in different regions, students will progress through the calendar towards the end of the year, learning about other major Hindu festivals along the way. Because of the diversity of religious perspectives in the sub-traditions of Hinduism, often the same events on these lunar calendars are imbued with multiple meanings and celebrated in various ways, so this course will put a special emphasis on learning when and how religious events are tied to entirely different mythologies and theologies, and how that creates opportunities for pluralistic encounters. Furthermore, since not all traditions under the umbrella of 'Hinduism' agree on one New Year or one supreme deity, the course also delves into alternative New Year celebrations, the deities and mythologies honored by them, and the issues of caste reflected by them. Throughout the course, students will learn about the ways in which devotees structure their lives around sacred dates, such as the birthdays and anniversaries of their chosen deities of worship, as well as commemorations of other mythological events. In addition to this, they will gain a perspective on food, visual art, dance, and music as aspects of life regulated by the Hindu calendar. Finally, the course will highlight cross-religious experiences, as certain major festivals transcend religious boundaries and share a history with some non-Hindu festivals that coincide with them. Knowledge of Sanskrit, other South Asian languages, or prior background in South Asian religions is not required for this course."

First, we will examine rasa theory as it is spelled out in the Sanskrit Nāṭyaśāstra, and we will then move on to dhvani or poetic resonance as an analytical category described by the theoreticians Ānandavardhana and Abhinavagupta. We will then move on to the themes of land and landscape, which are typical of early Tamil poetry, paying special attention to poetic convention and generic taxonomies. This will give us the means to study poetry produced in India's classical period. In tandem with our explorations of literary convention, we will read a Sanskrit play, as well as a wide variety of poems from various collections from the Sanskrit and Prākrit traditions. We will also read selections from the eight anthologies of classical Tamil that treat akam (romantic/erotic) and puram (heroic/ethical) themes. We will then move on to an exploration of epic and story literature from the Sanskrit and Tamil languages."

These include the recognition and formation of perfects, futures, gerundives, causatives, desideratives, and aorists. In addition to completing short assignments that refine these discrete skills, students interpret longer reading passages, including selections from the Rāmāyaṇa. The final month of the semester looks more like a traditional reading course. Using a dictionary to look up unfamiliar words, students read, analyze, and discuss the story of the encounter between Arjuna and Śiva in book 3 of the Sanskrit epic Mahābhārata. Students continue to read this story (and one of its poetic retellings, with commentary) in the spring semester. Overall, the intermediate- level Sanskrit course enables students to interpret Sanskrit texts in three major genres: epic, poetry, and scholarly prose. Students expand and strengthen the skills in reading comprehension, grammatical analysis, and vocabularyretention that they developed during the first year of study. Students will be able to dissect and describe nominal compounds, verbal forms, poetic meters, and morphological and syntactical features of Sanskrit words, sentences, and verses in greater detail.

In addition to developing the discrete skills above, students read and discuss three different Sanskrit texts. We continue the story that we began in the fall semester—that of the encounter between Arjuna and Śiva in book 3 of the Sanskrit epic Mahābhārata. Then we study Bhāravi's Kirātārjunīya, a sixth-century kāvya (poetic) composition based on that epic story.

Along the way, students will develop the ability to recognize many of the conventions of scholastic Sanskrit. No matter which texts we decide to read, it's safe to say that students will have a good deal of practice working with abstract noun constructions. Students will strengthen their scholastic vocabularies in general; in addition to that, students will develop technical vocabularies related to the texts they read and the specific intellectual discipline(s) in which those texts are situated. On the level of the longer passage or indeed the text as a whole, students will be able to (at different points) summarize, describe in detail, and critique the ideas that are being communicated in the text. Many lessons will involve students collaborating with their peers. No auditors will be permitted. Enrolled students must take the course for a letter grade."

Unlike Kauṇḍa Bhaṭṭa, he also seeks to refute the old and new Naiyāyikas' position that Īśvara's desire is the basis for direct expression (śakti), which itself constitutes linguistic convention (saṅketa). By separating the two concepts, Nāgeśa carves out a unique space for Īśvara within a Pāṇinīya's philosophy of language, which otherwise was exclusively dominated by the concepts of Śabdabrahman and sphoṭa. This course will also focus on portions of the Dhātvartha chapter in Nāgeśa's larger version of the Mañjūṣā, where he connects the theory of action and deliberations on existence (sattā) with his concept of the world as an illusory transformation (vivarta) of Brahman Requires at least two years of Sanskrit knowledge.

The choice of action is operationalized via a policy. A policy is a (stochastic) deterministic mapping from the available data at each time t into (a probability space over) the set of actions. We will consider both off- line and on-line methods for learning good policies. Mobile health is an area that lies within multiple scientific disciplines including: statistical science, computer science, behavioral science and cognitive neuroscience. This makes for very exciting interdisciplinary science! Smartphones and wearable devices have remarkable sensing capabilities allowing us to understand the context in which a person is at a given moment. These devices also have the ability to deliver treatment actions tailored to the specific needs of users in a given location at a given time. Figuring out when and in which context, which treatment actions to deliver can assist people in achieving their longer term health goals. In the last 15-20 minutes of many of the classes we will brainstorm about how the methods we discussed during that class might be useful in mobile health. This course will cover the following topics: Markov Decision Processes, on-policy and off-policy RL, least squares methods in RL and Bayesian RL, namely posterior sampling. Most of the course will focus on Bayesian RL via posterior sampling. This is particularly useful in mobile health as posterior sampling facilitates off-policy and continual learning. Also the Bayesian paradigm facilitates use of prior data in initializing an RL algorithm. Other topics from statistics, machine learning and RL that I think are potentially important in mobile health but that we won't cover are (you could consider in your class project) include: 1) transfer learning (using data on other similar users to enable faster learning); 2) non-stationarity (dealing with slowly changing or abrupt changes in user behavior); 3) interpretability of policies (enabling communication with behavioral scientists by making connections to behavioral theories); 4) using approximate system dynamic models to speed up learning, 5) hierarchical RL, 6) experience replay and 7) multi-task learning. Recommended prerequisites are the equivalent of Stat 210, Stat 211, and Compsci 181"

It explores and develops statistical theory and insights to contribute to the building of foundations for data science. The course provides a deep dive into statistical foundations and insights for multi-source, multi-phase, and multi-resolution learning, interwoven with case studies on using AI and Earth Observations (EO) for sustainable developments (e.g., global poverty). Foundational issues are framed as inevitable trade-offs for data science: between data quality and quantity, between statistical and computational efficiencies, and between robustness and relevance of learning methods and findings. Practical questions examined include handling messy and private data, drawing causal conclusions from AI-EO data, and translating scientific insights into policies. A student should preferably have at least one of the following background: - Foundational and theoretical proficiency: at the level of STATS 210, 211.

We will engage a number of plays, essays, videos, and live performances to explore the potential of expressive forms, and ask, what can be experienced and known through performance and performing? In doing so, we will address key questions:What constitutes a theatrical event? What are its component parts? What is the relationship between written dramas, scripts, scores, and embodied performance on the stage and in everyday life? What responsibilities do the actors, dancers, directors, choreographers, designers and other members of the production team have to previous incarnation or to an author's expressed intentions? How does the spectator co-create the meaning of a given production? How does one situate performance historically and from a theoretical perspective? And how can performance become a critical tool to engage cultural, political, and philosophical issues?You will be encouraged to develop your ability to think about performance from many different perspectives and to defend your individual ideas with strong critical skills.

We engage with methods and forms of theater, dance and media which may provide inspiration for your future artistic and scholarly work. Our strategy is to identify a number of contemporary and historical performances and performance archives and critically consider how they might influence your evolving identity as an artist working in live media, dance, and performance. We will delve deeply into genres of arts practices that could help you to imagine a way forward in your own work. In doing so, the goal is to advance your transition into a professional life in theater, dance, and media, and the identify your key concerns (both artistic and pragmatic) regarding a professional practice. Throughout the semester we will discuss how your personal goals and concerns intersect with political, social, and individual contemporary preoccupations in those fields. This junior tutorial is designed to organize participants into a community of singular artist interlocutors who can also supportively engage with one another's projects. You will develop methods to articulate your own intentions and impulses with great specificity, offer appropriate feedback for the stage of development for your peer's projects, and acquire facility with terms of art in theater, dance & media. Our semester is oriented to gaining autonomy and independence in relation to your interests. For the first seven weeks of the semester, we will read and explore a number of topics and ideas regarding the development of a sustainable arts practice, all the while, developing a specific set of questions pertinent to each class member's interests in the concentration. At the end of the seven weeks, students will present (both in person and online) on a company or artist whose work you have been researching in depth (the options are outlined in week 7 of the syllabus).

Or is it, perhaps, a composer, designer, or story writer? Does ballet technique confine the body, as the pioneers of modern dance used to assert, or is it a form of idealist philosophy, the ultimate expression of human freedom, as twentieth- century theorists of ballet have suggested?

We will explore movement techniques foundational to: creating characters; generating scripts and narratives; economizing and grounding stage presence; fostering ensemble cohesion; sensitizing the body to its unique capabilities of expression.Utilizing principles from Richard Maxwell, James Donlon, Charlie Oates, Anne Bogart, Blue Man Group and other ensembles/artists, we will attempt to anatomize an idealized 'neutrality', investigating the meaning and application of physical/environmental 'neutrality' on stage. We will identify the roles personal idiosyncrasy and 'disfluency' can play in the pursuit of that neutrality, and the opportunities and challenges they present to the performer. We will investigate rudimentary components of story, uncovering along the way the most essential markers for perceiving story, emotion and thought in physical performance. We will explore the beginnings of creating character and story through gradual stages using both non-verbal and text- based story (solo body, body in relationship to object, bodies in interrelationship w/ each other). In the latter part of the semester, we will experiment with stylistic schools of physical performance, including mime, Blue Man Group, Charlie Oates sculpture work, clowning/acrobatics and Viewpoints, and will also investigate ensemble cohesion and material generation through games and improvisation. Throughout the semester's explorations, we will also develop basic familiarity with simple yoga flow sequences, Taoist tai chi and other body practices geared toward conditioning/lengthening/ strengthening the physical instrument. The class will be both rigorously physical and dialectical, will include several short solo and ensemble performance pieces throughout the semester and will culminate in both a full-ensemble long form piece, as well as short individual pieces. physical, so appropriate dress is strongly recommended (as is prior communication about any physical issues/pain that would effect your ability to move comfortably; alternatives to assigned movements that may cause issues can always be offered).

Focus will continue to be on principles and practices of performative movement as it expands to include a compact survey of the global ritual underpinnings of movement performance (from the paleolithic era to present). Basic techniques will be introduced from selected performance traditions from Sanskrit, Kabuki, Kathakali theater traditions to Butoh dance, Grotowski's movement lab, Scott Graham's Frantic Method and Joshua Fried's headphone work. We will discuss how material may be generated through these performance methods (and will engage parallel discussion about the ethics of using quoted movement from cultural ritual and performance traditions).We will both investigate and physicalize the practices and methods of devised theater from the early 20th century to present (with a particular focus on the Dada and Futurist movements of 1910's-20's, as well as on the methods of Bertolt Brecht). Short Futurist and Dadaist scripts will be analyzed and performed as spoken text becomes more prevalent in composing classwork. Students will write a short paper on three generative techniques covered in class and will research--or create--a fourth generative technique (from any art form) and present/discuss briefly in class (and possibly physicalize, depending on the nature of the technique).Utilizing deeper levels of Viewpoints work, Richard Maxwell and BMG's 6-Archeypte Wheel, the Frantic Method and contact improvisation we'll explore more complex qualities of character, identity, archetype, mannerism, linguistic disfluencies (verbal and non-verbal) and psychological subtext.We will shortly immerse in the world of comedy improv w/ a series of games and exercises designed to deepen intuitive 'play' impulses, deepen ensemble cohesiveness and provide more methods for material generation. We will also briefly explore Rasa Boxes as an improvisational tool.Daily class time will often involve some sort of performance or improvisation by individuals or assigned small groups, culminating in final performance projects at the end of the semester. Along the way, we will continue practice of simple yoga flow sequences, Taoist tai chi and other body practices geared toward conditioning/lengthening/ strengthening the physical instrument.

This course explores the practical application of masks in theater performance for actors and puppeteers. Divided between mask construction and physical explorations, the course guides students through sculpting and rendering three separate masks, which are utilized in classroom performance exercises across the semester. Students study neutral mask, character mask, the counter mask, and complex character masks as it applies to acting without a mask. Object masks and full body creatures then take students into the realm of puppetry and mask theater where symbolic figures onstage offer opportunities for metaphor and distance from the particular.In the first half of the semester students build life masks and complex character masks in the workshop. Between these mask-making sessions, we practice physical technique. To begin, students study body isolations and expressive gesture for heightened kinesthetic awareness and movement analysis. Neutral mask work utilizes imaging and visualization techniques for identification with the four elements. Work with larval masks, life masks, and simple character masks takes us to midterm. Students present their completed complex character masks in a short performance as their midterm. In the second half of the semester we explore abstract 'creature' masks in ensemble scenes and encounters with objects. For the final, newly crafted masked creatures encounter the real world in an improvisation that moves across Harvard Yard.A supportive and collaborative culture is encouraged in the classroom to foster effective feedback among students who will work closely with one another."
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,TDM,129B,Performing Puppetry: Bringing Objects to Life,212802,2026 Spring,4,,,,,Arts and Humanities,Instructor Permission Required,"Kate Brehm This laboratory movement course teaches performers how to animate puppets and objects. Students develop a movement skillset different from that of the actor or dancer, specific to the puppeteer. While training students' bodies, the course expands their minds' ability to recognize the potential for liveness in all things and generate story without words. We work with simple objects, solo tabletop puppets, giant ensemble puppets, and bunraku- style dolls.Similar in format to a dance class, students begin each day with movement exercises training specific puppeteer skills: manipulating energy inside and outside the body; harnessing momentum and suspension; moving body appendages separately from one another; and performing 'invisibly.' Exercises lead into improvisations. Students learn to devise original dramatic material with patterns and movement dynamics in every class. We begin with non-anthropomorphic, simple objects like spheres and sticks, followed by materials that can spontaneously transform into creatures, like newspaper. At midterm, students each devise a solo scene with a tabletop puppet, figurative or otherwise. The foundation movement skills provide a common vocabulary for giving and receiving feedback. This trains students' eyes for analysis and offers a path forward for revising their performances.The second half of the course focuses on multi-operator puppets where leading and creative following is key. Students learn to perform in a group, attend to all action onstage, and, in improvisation, react with the best choice for the whole. With bunraku-style puppets, we study how to convey a sense of gravity, the mechanics of puppet walking and running, puppeteer choreography, and what makes a puppet appear to think and feel. Movement work is supplemented with short readings that engender a conversation on the nature of puppets. What is or isn't a puppet and why? Who is the puppeteer within a scene? How can this unique relationship dynamically change to support the storytelling? How does the inanimate nature of a puppet inspire choreography as well as thematic content? What is a puppet stage and how is it central to story and liveness? The final project is a group scene performed for a live audience during reading week. Homework includes practice videos, rehearsals, short readings, viewings, and journal entries."

It's a class about the enjoyable process of creating and presenting stories. The emphasis is on telling stories that the student has some kind of personal connection to. The course helps students define for themselves what kinds of stories they might want to tell, then helps them figure out what the important story points are, and how to make that story impactful.Over the course of the semester each student directs 3 very short pieces (1-3 minutes) and then 3 longer pieces (5-8 minutes). Each student will make at least one of the three very short pieces a recorded and edited video, and one a live theater event. After that, for the rest of the semester, students can either choose to do all video work, all live work, or switch back and forth. Students may direct any type of material that is of interest to them, including writing their own stories if they'd like. Students will often choose to write their own stories to more closely reflect their lives and personal interests. The students create these stories outside of class (shooting and editing video or rehearsing with friends to create a story performed live). We watch all the stories together as a class, and then offer our thoughts based on trying to help each director refine the story they are trying to tell. No previous live theater or video experience is needed for this course. Students will use free video editing software to create their video work, and we provide links that help each student get a quick handle on basic video editing techniques.While we'll look at some ways that the camera and editing are used in the storytelling, this is not a technical film making class – no instructions on how to use a camera or edit is offered. Most students use their phones to record their videos. It's a very safe, relaxed and warm environment, but the class does require a great deal of work outside of class. Students should expect to spend 4-6 hours per week on their story making. Students' grades are only based on their individual effort and not in comparison to the work of other students in the class."

In this course, we will explore how a wide range of contemporary choreographers are building on, rejecting, and transforming the formal techniques, concepts and ideas, and social and political projects of dance artists who came before them. How are today's choreographers using history to generate art that poses new questions, tests the boundaries of dance and performance, and resonates with audiences now? Each week, we will study the work of a contemporary choreographer side-by-side with that of a major figure in dance history who influenced them. Traversing a range of styles, we will learn about these artists' biographies, creative projects, and broader cultural contexts, and consider how they are in conversation across time and space. Examining dance films, images, memoirs, interviews with artists, and live performances, we will practice describing and analyzing movement as scholars and critics. Artists will include Justin Peck and Jerome Robbins, Jamar Roberts and Alvin Ailey, Pam Tanowitz and Merce Cunningham, Ayodele Casel and Juanita Pitts, and more."

Within Malian ideology, dance is a culture and there is no separation between dance and theatrical practice. Koteba is a masquerade performance tradition that utilizes the theatrical elements of satire to comment on and confront civic injustices within the Bamana ethnic society. Koteba is a word that means big snail in the Bamana language, and like the snail, it carries the ideologies and cosmologies of the Bamana people on its back. There are nearly 20 rhythm and movement stylings situated within Koteba. In a multiday festival, these dances are traditionally performed in succession, and often executed with the dancers forming concentric circles, which gives this theater tradition its snail-like name. Traces of this masquerade tradition can be found throughout the Caribbean and the United States in the form of Carnival and Mardi Gras.This class will focus on unpacking four of the dance and rhythm stylings over the course of 12 weeks: (1) Forokotoba, (2) Tansole, and (3) Bara/Baradong. The traditions of Noh drama, Sanskrit theater, and Greek tragedy have informed the development of American dance and theatrical forms, and similarly, a deep investigation of Koteba masquerade performance traditions will offer students of theater and dance informative tools as theorists, practitioners and historians."

The course asks many questions: What can we learn about musical theater by listening to the music that often informed it, but never made it to the stage in its authentic form? What can we learn about musical theater by listening to the popular music it influenced? What can we learn by creating radical conversations between ultra-modern pop and traditional show-tunes? What can we learn about the chosen subject matter of show-tunes vs no show tunes? What can we learn about race, class, gender, sexuality, capitalism and beyond by comparing how these subjects are framed in the show-tune realm vs the popular song realm?

We call this theater horizontal because its text, source material, and process are multivariate, self-consciously non-hierarchical, and aspirationally democratic: generated by and with communities through interviews.In this workshop students will build and present a reading of a full-length piece of horizontal theater. They will collectively choose the topic and scope of the production, study existing models, and interrogate the design of live theater in order to develop an original aesthetic sensibility for a stage presentation. Students will determine by consensus whom to interview and about what subject of interest; they will conduct those interviews, record them, and transcribe them; and they will use verbatim language from those interviews to build lyrics, write songs, monologues, and dialogue, ultimately constructing a full-length play with music and/or a musical.In addition, students will examine existing models of horizontal theater and discuss the politics of representation and risks of appropriation that surface in this kind of work. Models of meaningful horizontal theater include (but are not limited to): Lynn Nottage's Sweat, Anna Deavere Smith's Fires in the Mirror, Tectonic Theater Project's The Laramie Project, and The Civilians' Gone Missing, and In the Footprint. Students will also engage with problems that arise from horizontal theater: first, the confusion that can attend horizontal theater when aesthetic demands conflict with journalistic ethics such as that generated by Mike Daisey's The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs; second, the erasure caused by ignoring lineage, representation, membership, and appropriation, as represented by the conflict of rightful authorship between Tourmaline and David France over their respective documentaries about Marsha P. Johnson. This workshop has the spirit of a lab, wherein the aesthetics of horizontal theater are modeled, deconstructed, questioned, and ideally re-invented, where students think seriously about the identities of their subjects as well as their own, and where conversations about art-making, presentation, and politics are courageous, respectful, and never less than daring.

Examining how these authors draw on traditions crafted by earlier authors such as James Baldwin and Virginia Woolf, we'll ask what this tradition has accomplished in different historical moments and how genres such as the personal essay and the op-ed have been implicitly gendered. We will think about our own cultural moment, in which we are collectively encouraged to tell our story via an endless proliferation of self-revelatory texts (blogs, TikTok, Twitter).

In this course, we will investigate the role of colonialism and neocolonialism in racial imaginations of gender and sexuality and how these histories shape contemporary understandings of LGBTQ politics, reproductive and sexual rights, and anti-colonial resistance around the world. We will explore histories of sexual control, colonial and racial difference, and marginalized, queer, and trans sexualities in colonial and postcolonial spaces, including parts of West Asia, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa.
